"""
This module is the point of entry for all NOS plugins.
It imports all the NOS plugins and loads them into a dictionary.

The NOS plugins are loaded first, using the .py modules and
then the .yaml files in the platforms directory for those which are left.

With .py modules we can have functionality, while using YAML is only
intended for quick development of new NOS plugins.
