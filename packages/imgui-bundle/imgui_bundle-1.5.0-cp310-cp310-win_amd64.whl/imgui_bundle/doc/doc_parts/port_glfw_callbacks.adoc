=== Advanced glfw callbacks

When using the glfw backend, you can set advanced callbacks on all glfw events.

Below is an example that triggers a callback whenever the window size is changed:

[source,python]
----
import imgui_bundle
import glfw   # always import glfw *after* imgui_bundle!!!


# define a callback
def my_window_size_callback(window: glfw._GLFWwindow, w: int, h: int):
    print(f"Window size changed to {w}x{h}")


# Get the glfw window used by hello imgui
window = imgui_bundle.glfw_utils.glfw_window_hello_imgui()
glfw.set_window_size_callback(window, my_window_size_callback)
----

CAUTION: It is important to import glfw _after_ imgui_bundle, since - upon import - imgui_bundle informs glfw that it shall use its own version of the glfw dynamic library.
