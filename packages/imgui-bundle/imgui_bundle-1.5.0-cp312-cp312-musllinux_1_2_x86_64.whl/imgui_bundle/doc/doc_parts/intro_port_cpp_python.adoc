=== Easily port your code between python and {cpp}

The python bindings are autogenerated via an advanced generator (so that keeping them up to date is easy), and closely mirror the original {cpp} API, with fully typed bindings.

The original code documentation is meticulously kept inside the python stubs. See for example the documentation for https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/$$__init__$$.pyi[imgui]
, https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi[implot], and https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi[hello imgui]

Thanks to this, code completion in your favorite python IDE works like a charm, and porting code between Python and {cpp} becomes easy.

TIP: GPT can help you translate between C++ and Python: see link:https://chat.openai.com/share/1e61dfec-c2de-4c2a-8149-24926276bbd5[this conversation] where GPT4 was used to translate code and summarize the differences between the {cpp} and Python APIs.
