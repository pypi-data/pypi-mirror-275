# fuzzquery
A lightweight package for performing fuzzy string matching with a very simple token system.

--------

## Queries:

Tokens are used to represent unknown/fuzzy data. The 3 types of tokens are:

| token  | type    | description                           | example           | result-like                     |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `{x}`  | range   | 0 to `x` non-whitespace characters    | `"home{5}"`       | `home, homestead, homeward`     |
| `{!x}` | strict  | exactly `x` non-whitespace characters | `"{1}ward{!2}"`   | `warden, awarded`               |
| `{?}`  | unknown | 0 or more unknown **words**           | `"thou {?} kill"` | `thou shalt not kill`           |

__The `unknown` token must be segregated in the space between any 2 terms, exactly as illustrated in the above example.__

## Documentation:

**note:**
`list|tuple|set` is aliased as `Iter` to simplify documentation. There is no `Iter` type in the `fuzzquery` package.

## Examples:

```python3
import fuzzquery as fq

data = """

When I arrived, I was greeted by a homely man that told me the homestead was awarded 5 million dollars.

"""
queries = ('hom{5} {?} wa{!1}{5}', 
           'home{5}', 
           '{1}ward{!2}{2}',

for query, span, match in fq.iterall(data, queries, ci=True):

#### output
