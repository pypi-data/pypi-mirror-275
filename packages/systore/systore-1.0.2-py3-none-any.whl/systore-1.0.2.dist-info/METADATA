# Library
This is a easy to use python library to get information about your system! Such as how much ram you have, Cpu cores etc.

```python
import systore
result = systore.get_disk_partitions()
print(result) # All disk partitions on your system
```

# Installation
```bash
pip install systore
```

# Documentation
These are all the functions, They are pretty much self explanatory.
More functions coming in future updates. Also, this library is based on psutils. This library is way easier than psutil too.
