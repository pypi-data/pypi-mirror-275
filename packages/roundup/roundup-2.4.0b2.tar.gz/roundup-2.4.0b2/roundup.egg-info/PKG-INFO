I'm proud to release version 2.4.0 beta 1 of the Roundup issue
tracker.  This release is a bugfix and feature
release, so make sure to read `docs/upgrading.txt
<https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>`_ to
bring your tracker up to date.

The 67 changes, as usual, include some new features and many
bug fixes.

Note that you should run ``roundup-admin ... migrate`` to
update the database schema version. Do this before you use
the web, command-line or mail interface and before any users
access the tracker.

You can install it with::

   pip install roundup~=2.4.0b2

(preferably in a virtual environment). To download it, use::

   pip download roundup~=2.4.0b2

then unpack and test/install from the tarball.

Beta 2 includes a small change to the classic tracker's
classhelper.js to fix a bug found after beta 1 was released.

Among the notable improvements in 2.4.0 from the 2.3.0
release are:

* new classhelper component thanks to a team of students
  from CS682 at U-Mass Boston. This fixes many issues with
  the old classhelper. It is implemented as a web-component
  and needs REST interface access. It will fall back to the
  classic classhelper if REST is not available or if the
  browser does not support web-components.

* fix Windows Python installation using pip. It used to go
  into an infinite loop during install or download. Also fix
  installation of shared files (templates) so roundup-admin
  can find them.

* using ``@current_user`` as a value in a search URL for a
  user property will use the current logged in user. Now you
  can share searches like: "My issues" as "my" will become
  the current logged in user.

* login failures to the REST/XML-RPC interfaces are now rate
  limited to limit password guessing attacks.

* utf8mb4 is the default charset for MySQL. This requires
  migrating your database using the mysql client. You can
  choose to keep the older character set in config.ini.

* PostgreSQL services defined in pg_service.conf can be
  used.  PostgreSQL schemas are supported to eliminate the
  need for the roundup user to have database
  creation/deletion privileges.

* fix out of memory issue when importing larger trackers
  into PostgreSQL.

* multiple roundup-admin improvements: display protected
  properties (like creation date), better formatting of
  output, command history. Also on windows, pyreadline3 is
  supported to provide an editable interactive command line.

* an experimental wsgi performance improvement in 2.3.0 is
  now now the default and is opt-out.

* new template functions: utils.readfile and
  utils.expandfile. Javascript that is included in the
  Python core will be moved to external files and be able to
  have values from Roundup substituted in the Javascript.

* allow content-type of a template to be set from inside the
  template.  This allows returning json or xml from a
  template without a .json or .xml extention.

* fix import/export on windows to use Unix style line
  endings fixing export/import on Windows and making exports
  portable across platforms.

* various other Windows platform fixes including test suite
  fixes.

* sqlite version 1 and StructuredText support removed.

The file CHANGES.txt has a detailed list of feature
additions and bug fixes (67) for each release. The most
recent changes from there are at the end of this
announcement. Also see the information in doc/upgrading.txt.

If you find bugs, please report them to issues AT
roundup-tracker.org or create an account at
https://issues.roundup-tracker.org and open a new ticket. If
you have patches to fix the issues they can be attached to
the email or uploaded to the tracker.

Upgrading
=========

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you
*must* follow all the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in
the doc/upgrading.txt documentation.

Note that you should run ``roundup-admin ... migrate`` for
all your trackers to update the database schema version. Do
this before you use the web, command-line or mail interface
and before any users access the tracker.

Roundup requires Python 2 newer than version 2.7.12 or
Python 3 newer than or equal to version 3.6 for correct
operation. (Python 3.4 or 3.5 may work, but are not tested.)
Note that Python 2 support is being removed from the CI
platforms, so you should deploy new trackers with Python 3
and plan on upgrading older trackers from Python 2 to Python
3. See the upgrade guide.

To give Roundup a try, just download (directions above),
unpack and run::

    python demo.py

then open the url printed by the demo app.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and install issue-tracking system
with command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on
the winning design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software
Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties
such as "description", "priority", and so on) and provides
the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system facilitates communication among the participants
by managing discussions and notifying interested parties
when issues are edited. One of the major design goals for
Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup is therefore
usable "out of the box" with any Python 3.6+
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be
operational, though an install script is provided.

It comes with five basic issue tracker templates

* a classic bug/feature tracker
* a more extensive devel tracker for bug/features etc.
* a responsive version of the devel tracker
* a jinja2 version of the devel template (work in progress)
* a minimal skeleton

and supports four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
