Upgrade to AdvancedBaseAction
=============================

With this release we introduce a new :ref:`AdvancedBaseAction <api_reference/AdvancedBaseAction>` to 
provide a more off the shelf set of functions to simplify the build of ftrack actions.

Being the new :ref:`AdvancedBaseAction <api_reference/AdvancedBaseAction>` class fully interchangeable with the :ref:`BaseAction <api_reference/BaseAction>`
    
Actions build on the :ref:`BaseAction <api_reference/BaseAction>` class can be easily 
upgraded to the new :ref:`AdvancedBaseAction <api_reference/AdvancedBaseAction>` changing the baseclass, from:

.. code::

    class MyActionClass(BaseAction):
        pass

to: 

.. code::

    class MyActionClass(AdvancedBaseAction):
        pass


The new baseclass can now start using the new features:

.. code::

    class MyActionClass(AdvancedBaseAction):
        limit_to_user = True
