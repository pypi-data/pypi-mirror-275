This package only contains one class `BaseAction`. It simplifies the configuration of a new
action by registering with the event hub and converting the events emitted from the server
to a more pythonic data representation.

The example actions below can be run directly or added to your ftrack connect plugin path
for more information see the main ftrack `documentation <http://ftrack-python-api.rtd.ftrack.com/en/latest/understanding_sessions.html#configuring-plugins>`_.
