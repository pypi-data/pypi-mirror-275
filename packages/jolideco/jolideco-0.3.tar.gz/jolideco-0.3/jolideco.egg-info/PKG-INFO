Jolideco is a Python package for Joint Likelihood Deconvolution of astronomical images affected by
Poisson noise. It allows you to deblur and denoise images and do a joint image reconstruction of
multiple images from different instruments, while taking their specific instrument response functions,
such as point spread functions, exposure and instrument specific background emission into account.
To ensure a high fidelity of reconstructed features in the images, Jolideco relies on a patch based
image prior, which is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

Contributing
------------
While contributions are welcome in general, currently I cannot review PRs, nor help with implementations,
because of a lack of time. So PRs are unlikely to get merged. However any kind of bug report or feature
requests are welcome as well.
