**decalmlutils** is a lightweight python library that contains functions and code snippets that
I use in my everyday research with Machine Learning.

I created this repo because I was tired of always looking up same code from older projects.
By making this available to everyone it gives me easy access to code I use frequently and it can help others in their machine learning work.
If you find any bugs or something doesn't make sense please feel free to open an issue.

# decalmlutils

## Installation

You can install `decalmlutils` with pip from GitHub:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/crypdick/decalmlutils"
```

Or locally, by cloning the repository and running:

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```


## Functions

All function implemented in the **decalmlutils** module.

### Array Functions

Array manipulation related function that can be useful when working with machine learning.


### Plot Functions

Plot related function that can be useful when working with machine learning.


### Text Functions

Text related function that can be useful when working with machine learning.



### Web Related

# Boilerplate

These are code snippets which need to be modified before they can be used in a project.
I keep them in a separate directory so that they do not clutter the `decalmlutils` package.
