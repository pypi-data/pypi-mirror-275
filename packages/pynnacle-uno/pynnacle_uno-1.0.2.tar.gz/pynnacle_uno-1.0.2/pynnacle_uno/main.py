    The pynnacle-uno module was originally created for the readers of the book 'Bot Adventures: Discovering the Mysteries of Robotics' authored by
    Team Pinnacle. This simple module was built on top of Pymata4, and it was designed to provide beginners with robotics coding experience in
    Python that's relatively close to the Arduino's programming language. This is to hopefully provide them with easier transition once they
    start learning Arduino's programming language which is relatively more challenging to learn than Python. Lastly, this was mainly created
    for Arduino UNO. Although this might work for some boards to some extent, it is highly recommended that you use Arduino UNO for this module.

    DISCLAIMER:
        Some functions were changed by the book authors to cause a slightly different effect from the original Arduino's programming language.
        This was done to align with the mission of the book to teach and expose absolute beginners in the field of robotics in a simple way.
