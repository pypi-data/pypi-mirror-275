# Introduction

The **pynnacle-uno** module was initially crafted to cater to readers of the acclaimed book **_'Bot Adventures: Discovering the Mysteries of Robotics'_** authored by Team Pinnacle. This module was built on top of the robust foundation of [Pymata4](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata4/) by Alan Yorinks. It is aimed at providing novice enthusiasts with a hands-on robotics coding experience in Python that closely mirrors the structure and functionality of Arduino's programming language. The primary objective behind its creation is to facilitate a smoother transition for learners as they delve into the intricacies of Arduino's programming language, which is renowned for its steep learning curve compared to Python.

# Compatibility and Recommendations

The **pynnacle-uno** module is primarily designed for use with the Arduino UNO board, offering optimal compatibility and performance. While it may function with other Arduino boards to some extent, it is highly recommended to utilize the Arduino UNO for seamless integration and comprehensive feature support.

**Disclaimer:** It is important to note that certain functions within the module have been deliberately modified by the book authors to produce slightly different outcomes compared to the original Arduino programming language. Furthermore, some functions in this module are not found in the original programming language of Arduino. **These deliberate modifications were implemented to harmonize with the book's content** and uphold the authors' primary mission: to introduce robotics to absolute beginners in a simplified and intuitive manner.

# Team Pinnacle

The development of the **pynnacle-uno** module would not have been possible without the dedication of Team Pinnacle, comprising the following individuals:

1.  **Red Hizon**

2.  **Jenel Justo**

3.  **Serena Lee**

_Their aim is to enhance the accessibility and user-friendliness of robotics and programming education for a wide range of learners._
