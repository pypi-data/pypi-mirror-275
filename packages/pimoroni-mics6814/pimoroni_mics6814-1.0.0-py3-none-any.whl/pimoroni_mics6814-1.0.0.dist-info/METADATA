## Installing

### Pre-requisites

You must enable i2c:

* i2c: `sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0`

You can optionally run `sudo raspi-config` or the graphical Raspberry Pi Configuration UI to enable interfaces.

### Full install (recommended):

We've created an easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your BH1745
up and running with minimal efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal
on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated below:

![Finding the terminal](http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png)

In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:
