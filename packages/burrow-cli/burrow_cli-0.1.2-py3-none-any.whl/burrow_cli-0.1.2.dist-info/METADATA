# Share part of your GPU with your friends!

* With Burrow, you can share part of your GPU with your friends with a single link! 🚀🔗
* Work collaboratively in the same terminal, especially thanks to sshx.io 👨‍💻👩‍💻
* With security in mind, Burrow uses sandbox Docker containers, so your friends can't access your local files. 🛡️🐳🔒
