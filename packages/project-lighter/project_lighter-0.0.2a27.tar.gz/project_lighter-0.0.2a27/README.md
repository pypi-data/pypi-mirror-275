With `lighter`, focus on your deep learning experiments and forget about boilerplate through:
 1. **Task-agnostic** training logic already implemented for you (classification, segmentation, self-supervised, etc.)
 2. **Configuration-based** approach that will ensure that you can always reproduce your experiments and know what hyperparameters you used.
 3. Extremely **simple integration of custom** models, datasets, transforms, or any other components to your experiments.

&nbsp;

`lighter` stands on the shoulder of these two giants:
 - [MONAI Bundle](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/bundle_intro.html) - Configuration system. Similar to [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra), but with additional features.
 - [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning) - Our [`LighterSystem`](https://project-lighter.github.io/lighter/reference/system/) is based on the PyTorch Lightning [`LightningModule`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/lightning_module.html) and implements all the necessary training logic for you. Couple it with the PyTorch Lightning [Trainer](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html) and you're good to go.
 
Simply put, `lighter = config(trainer + system)` ðŸ˜‡
