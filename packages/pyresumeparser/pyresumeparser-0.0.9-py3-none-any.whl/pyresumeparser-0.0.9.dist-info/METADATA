# PyResumeParser

PyResumeParser is a Python package designed to parse resume PDF files and extract key entities such as names, emails, phone numbers, education details, skills, and more. It utilizes spaCy and pdfminer.six for natural language processing and PDF text extraction. It requires Python version 3.10 or higher.

## Installation

You can install PyResumeParser using pip:

```bash
pip install pyresumeparser
```

## Usage

### As a Python Module

To use PyResumeParser in your Python code, you can import the package and call the `parse_resume` function:

```python
import pyresumeparser

pdf_file = "resume.pdf"
parsed_resume = pyresumeparser.parse_resume(pdf_file)
print(parsed_resume)
```

### From the Terminal

You can also use PyResumeParser directly from the terminal:

```bash
pyresumeparser resume.pdf
```

This command will parse the specified PDF file and print the extracted entities in JSON format.

## Example Output

```json
{
