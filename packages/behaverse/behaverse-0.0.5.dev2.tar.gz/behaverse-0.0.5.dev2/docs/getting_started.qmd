# Getting Started

To access datasets via the API, you first need to install the `behaverse` Python package. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install behaverse
```

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system. We recommend using a virtual environment such as Mamba to manage your dependencies.


# Usage

The `behaverse` package provides a simple API to access datasets. You can use the `behaverse` package to download datasets, load them into memory, and access the data. Here is an example of how to use the package to list available datasets, download a dataset, select a subset of the dataset, and load it into memory:

```{python}
from behaverse import list_datasets, download_dataset, load_dataset
from IPython.display import display

# List available datasets
print(list_datasets())

# Open a dataset, select a subset of the data, and load it into memory
dataset = open_dataset('P500_L1m').select(subject_id=['001', '002']).load()
display(dataset.subjects)
display(dataset.study_flow)
display(dataset.response)
describe_dataset(dataset)
```
