IFT NXOPEN API
===============

**Beschreibung**

This repository contains an API for the IFT in Siemens NX. The classes in this API use the NXOpen API to get important data from a Siemens NX Session. 

This package was generated for the SurfAlce project, but the functionalities of the different classes can be used 
in any other project. 

All classes and their methods can be found in the folder `./src/IFT` in the Folder `./scripts`however you can find scripts that can be executed from Siemens NX. 

Before you can use these functionalities, stick to the setup instructions below.

**Setup** 

- [Install Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) if not already installed and remind the installation directory.
- Add following system variables to the  `%UGII_BASE_DIR%/UGII/ugii_env.dat` file.
- `UGII_PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR = <installation directory>/Python38`
- `UGII_PYTHONPATH = %UGII_PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR%;%UGII_PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR%\DLLs;%UGII_PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR%\Lib;%UGII_PYTHON_LIBRARY_DIR%\Lib\site-packages;%UGII_BASE_DIR%\nxbin\python`
- `UGII_CAM_WRITE_MRR = <abitrary directory with writing permisions>`
- Install the API into the python distribution via pip with the following command `pip install git+https://git.ift.tuwien.ac.at/lab/ift/sis/data-science/nxopen-export.git`
- Open a Siemens NX CAM-Setup
- If not already done, enable the Developer tab, by right-click on the blue ribbon at the top of NX and set a tick to "Developer"
- Press "Play" and search for the `./scripts/nx_data_export.py` file available in the gitlab repository.
- The script can be executed via the callback-function of a personalized button in the NX Ribbon. 

> NOTE: None of the system variables specified above, expecially `UGII_PYTHONPATH`,  may exceed 256 characters.
