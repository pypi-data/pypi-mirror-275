Neofbs is a fork of fbs. The original project is locked to Python 3.5 and 3.6, which are not supported anymore. To have the more recent versions, you have to pay â‚¬50.
Obviously, the paid versions have a lot more features, but atleast with neofbs you can start a project, package it into a .exe and then package it into an installer.

To download it, simply use pip:

```
pip install neofbs
```

And then, follow the guide in the original fbs website --- the commands are the same.

See for a guide of how to use:
