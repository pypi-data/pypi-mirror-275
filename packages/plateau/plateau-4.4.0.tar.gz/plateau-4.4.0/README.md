`plateau` is a Python library to manage (create, read, update, delete) large
amounts of tabular data in a blob store. It stores data as datasets, which
it presents as pandas DataFrames to the user. Datasets are a collection of
files with the same schema that reside in a blob store. plateau uses a metadata
definition to handle these datasets efficiently. For distributed access and
manipulation of datasets plateau offers a [Dask](https://dask.org) interface.

Storing data distributed over multiple files in a blob store (S3, ABS, GCS,
etc.) allows for a fast, cost-efficient and highly scalable data infrastructure.
A downside of storing data solely in an object store is that the storages
themselves give little to no guarantees beyond the consistency of a single file.
In particular, they cannot guarantee the consistency of your dataset. If we
demand a consistent state of our dataset at all times, we need to track the
state of the dataset. plateau frees us from having to do this manually.

The `plateau.io` module provides building blocks to create and modify these
datasets in data pipelines. plateau handles I/O, tracks dataset partitions
and selects subsets of data transparently.
