# Cambridge

`cambridge` is a terminal version of Cambridge Dictionary, with its data from https://dictionary.cambridge.org

By default, it is English to English translation. For English to Chinese, add '-c' or '--chinese' option.

Supports looking up the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, with `-w` or `--webster` option. Webster has no foreign language translation in itself.

## Why This
I'm a terminal person tired of pulling out a GUI app or browser, inputting words in the search bar, hitting the search button and then waiting for the result to render with a bunch of unnecessary static files coming along. Not only is the time taken long, but also switching apps back and forth can be annoying. So I wrote this console application with features to my satisfaction.

## Highlights
1. `camb <word/phrase>` to look it up in Cambridge Dictionary by default
2. `-w` flag to fetch Merriam-Webster Dictionary
3. less than 2s taken to do all the work for the word, including fetching, parsing, printing, and writing cache
4. less than 0.1s for the same word's later search
5. only the first dictionary from Cambridge (assuming the optimal) to avoid being confused by multiple dictionaries
6. a list of word/phrase suggestions will be given, if not found
7. `camb l` to list words and phrases you've found before
8. colorscheme well customized to dark, light, blueish, grayish, gruvbox terminal backgrounds

## `fzf`
With [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed, `camb l | fzf --preview 'camb {}'` will get you a taste of the `fzf` magic:
1. display the whole word list
2. fuzzy find a word from the word list & preview its meaning instantly
3. preview each word definition instantly as you scroll through the list
4. `alias cambl="camb l | fzf --preview 'camb {}'"` can be added in your `.bashrc` for convenience

## TO-DOS
* [ ] input a new word/phrase when spelling suggestions are not satisfactory without restarting a new command line
* [ ] check a particular expression against all cached sentence examples, if found, we can confidently use it like that in our speaking or writing
* [ ] split and accumulate all sentences from a whole bulk of cache as independent Corpus, then we can use this Corpus outside this program
* [ ] strengthen 'Word of the Day' functionality from Webster
