# My watch_run Project

This is a plugin only for Python that enables easy monitoring of parameter changes without needing to modify the source code.

What is particularly noteworthy is that it allows for monitoring of parameter changes through class objects in a production environment without affecting the runtime speed(just like print). 

It is especially useful for streamlining the execution process and monitoring for bugs in a production environment.

Run 'watch_run main.py' in the same place where you previously run 'python3 main.py'. This is the only command.

## Installation

```sh
pip install watch_run
```

## Usage

```sh
watch_run main.py
```

## Features

Monitor Ordinary Variables: Free of charge. Provides monitoring at 10-15 times the normal runtime speed.

Monitor through Class Objects: Paid feature. Enables monitoring in a production environment without impacting performance.
You can purchase this feature through the application interface.
