# FishShrimpCrab

Hoo Hey How (Chinese: 魚蝦蟹; pinyin: yú xiā xiè; lit. 'Fish-Prawn-Crab') is a Chinese dice game played with three identical six-sided dice. It is related to Bầu cua cá cọp in Vietnam, Klah Klok (Khmer: ខ្លាឃ្លោក, romanized: khlaa khlook, lit. 'leopard') in Cambodia,[2] and similar to Crown and Anchor in the West Indies and the American game chuck-a-luck.[3][4][5]
