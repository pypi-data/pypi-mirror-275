# lcodePy

## Overview 

LCODE is a free software for numerical simulation of
particle beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration.
LCODE is based on the quasistatic approximation, capable
of simulation in 2D and 3D geometry, and can use GPUs and CPUs.

For now, this under active development. This is
a complete overhaul of the old C version in Python.

## Instalation 

We use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) and we recommend 
installing lcode in a separate environment. 
Any other python installation should work fine, but has not been tested. 


- Create a new environment and install the dependencies:
```
conda create -n lcode-env -c conda-forge numba numpy scipy matplotlib mpi4py
```
or 
```
conda env create -f conda-env.yml  
```
where `conda-env.yml` is avalible in sources.

- Acivate the new environment:
```
conda activate lcode-env
```

- **Optional**: in order to run simulations on GPU, add cupy and other necessary packages to the line of dependencies when creating a new eviroment. Check in advance if you have the drivers for your GPU installed. It is not necessary to install CUDA Toolkit in advance. For any other questions about cupy, please check https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html
```
conda create -n lcode-env -c conda-forge numba numpy scipy matplotlib cupy
```

- Install lcode:
```
pip install lcode
```
or download sources from GitHub and run the forlowing command
in downloaded directory:
```
pip install .
```
