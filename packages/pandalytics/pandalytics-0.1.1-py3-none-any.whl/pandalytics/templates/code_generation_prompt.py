----------------------------
When you generate the pandas code, Update the initial code:

```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

## declare result variable here

# Write code here

print(result)
```

Generate python code and return full updated code:

Take a deep breath and thoroughly analyze the dataframe's metadata to gain a comprehensive understanding. The metadata is as follows:\n {metadata}
Next, carefully analyze the user query: {query} and extract all necessary data from the metadata to generate the required pandas code.
The file path is: {file_path}

You needs to pay special attention while writing code for comparing the values. Use the exact values from csv file for comparing the values.

Ensure that the generated code can run independently without any additional modifications.
**Note:** You MUST only provide the pandas code as output.
