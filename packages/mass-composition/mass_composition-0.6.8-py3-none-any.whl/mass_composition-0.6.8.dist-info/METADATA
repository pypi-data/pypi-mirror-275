# MassComposition

[![Run Tests](https://github.com/Elphick/mass-composition/actions/workflows/poetry_build_and_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Elphick/mass-composition/actions/workflows/poetry_build_and_test.yml)

MassComposition is a python package that allows Geoscientists and Metallurgists to easily work with, and visualise
mass-compositional data.

Mass Composition in this context is just that - Mass *and* Composition.  It is not Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA), 
since here we care more about mathematical operations like weight averaging and technically correct mathematical 
operations.  Of course, we also need to manage moisture correctly - chemical composition is reported on a dry basis 
and moisture on a wet basis.

The package not only supports individual MassComposition, but collections of objects that are 
mathematically related in a Directional Graph (a.k.a. network or flowsheet).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of the mass-composition python package.
* You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.
* You have read the [docs](https://elphick.github.io/mass-composition).

## Installing MassComposition

To install MassComposition, follow these steps:

```
pip install mass-composition -e .[viz,network]
```

Or, if poetry is more your flavour.

```
poetry add "mass-composition[viz,network]"
```

## Using MassComposition

To use MassComposition, follow these steps:

There are some basic requirements that the incoming DataFrame must meet.  We'll use a sample DataFrame here.

```python    
df_data: pd.DataFrame = sample_data()
```

Create the object

```python
obj_mc: MassComposition = MassComposition(df_data)
```

It is then trivial to calculate the weight average aggregate of the dataset.

```python
obj_mc.aggregate()
```

Multiple composition analytes can be viewed in a single interactive parallel coordinates plot.

```python
obj_mc: MassComposition = MassComposition(df_data.reset_index().set_index(['DHID', 'interval_from', 'interval_to']),
                                          name=name)

fig: Figure = obj_mc.plot_parallel(color='Fe')
fig
```


Network visualisations and other plots are interactive.
