# ERAS
Easily Runnable AI Shell allows you to run shell commands using natural language.   

No more having to leave the terminal to look up how to run a command!

Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux!

# Install

## Mac & Linux
```
pip install eras
```

If you get an error about externally-managed-environment it's because you have python installed via homebrew, and need to use pipx instead:

pipx
``` 
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install eras
```
With pipx you may need to open a new terminal window or source .zshrc a couple of times.

## Windows
```
pip install eras
```

You will be prompted for various configuration settings.  Once set, close your terminal window and open up a new one.
# Use
Grab an OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

The first use of Eras will prompt you to enter an OpenAI key, which it will save to your profile as `ERAS_OPENAI_KEY`

The first use will also prompt you to allow accessibility features for Terminal.app, which is required to allow Eras to populate
the terminal with the shell command.

When you ask Eras a question, it will use AI to create a shell command, then populate your next terminal line with the command, so all you have to do is review and press enter.

## Usage Examples
```
% eras list all files in the current directory

ERAS will then populate the next terminal line with the command:
% ls

All you have to do is confirm and hit enter!

...
% eras create a new file named jason.txt with contents "hello world"
% echo "hello world" > jason.txt
...

```
### Chat Examples
```
% eras /chat What is the capital of France 
% Paris is the capital of France

Note: if you want to use ? or other special terminal chars you should surround your question in quotes
% eras /chat "What is the capital of France?"
% Paris is the capital of France
```

# Upcoming functionality

## Llama 3 support
Llama.cpp provides an API similar to OpenAI, so pointing eras at http://127.0.0.1:8080 works as expected.  

I just need to prompt for the base_url preference and use it.
