# KFP Support Library

This library is aimed to simplify transform pipelines implementations and consists of 2 main parts:

* [API Server Client](../src/kfp_support/api_server_client/README.md)
* [workflow support](../src/kfp_support/workflow_support/README.md)

See also how this library is used for [kfp components](../../kfp_ray_components/README.md) implementation
and implementation of the actual [workflow](../../doc/simple_transform_pipeline.md)
