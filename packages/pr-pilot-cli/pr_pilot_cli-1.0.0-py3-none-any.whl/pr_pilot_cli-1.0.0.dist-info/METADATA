# PR Pilot CLI

## Overview
The PR Pilot CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to interact with the PR Pilot API. It allows users to automate tasks related to pull requests and issue management on GitHub repositories.

## Features
- **Configuration Management**: Automatically manages API key configuration by prompting the user to input their API key if not already configured.
- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by specifying a repository and a prompt. The CLI handles task creation and optionally waits for the result.
- **Result Retrieval**: If the `--wait` option is used, the CLI waits for the task to complete and displays the result directly in the terminal.
- **Dashboard Link**: For tasks that are not awaited, the CLI provides a link to the task's dashboard for further monitoring.

## Installation
To use the PR Pilot CLI, users need to install it on their system. The installation process typically involves cloning the repository and setting up the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
To use the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
python cli.py --wait <repo> <prompt>
```

Replace `<repo>` and `<prompt>` with the appropriate repository and task prompt.

## Configuration
The configuration file is located at `~/.pr-pilot.yaml`. Users need to ensure that their API key is correctly configured to use the CLI effectively.

## Contributing
Contributors are welcome to improve the CLI by submitting pull requests or reporting issues. For more details, check the project's GitHub repository.

## License
The PR Pilot CLI is open-source software licensed under the MIT license.
