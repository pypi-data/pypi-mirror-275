# PR Pilot CLI

The PR Pilot CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to interact with the PR Pilot API. 
It allows users to quickly hand over work to PR Pilot from the command line.

## Features
- **Configuration Management**: Automatically manages API key configuration by prompting the user to input their API key if not already configured.
- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by specifying a repository and a prompt. The CLI handles task creation and optionally waits for the result.
- **Result Retrieval**: If the `--wait` option is used, the CLI waits for the task to complete and displays the result directly in the terminal.
- **Dashboard Link**: For tasks that are not awaited, the CLI provides a link to the task's dashboard for further monitoring.

```bash

By default, the CLI will prompt you to input your API key if it is not already configured.
