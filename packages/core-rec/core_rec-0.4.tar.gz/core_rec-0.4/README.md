# Graph Analysis and Recommendation System

Welcome to the Graph Analysis and Recommendation System! This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing graph data, as well as recommending similar nodes within a graph. Let's explore the main functionalities of this codebase:

## vishgraphs
```
import vishgraphs as vg
```
### 1. `generate_random_graph(num_people, file_path="graph_dataset.csv", seed=None)`

This function generates a random graph with a specified number of people and saves the adjacency matrix to a CSV file.

**Use case:** Generating synthetic graph data for testing algorithms or simulations.

### 2. `draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)`

Draws a 2D visualization of a graph based on its adjacency matrix, highlighting top nodes if specified.

**Use case:** Visualizing relationships within a graph dataset.

### 3. `find_top_nodes(matrix, num_nodes=10)`

Identifies the top nodes with the greatest number of strong correlations in a graph.

**Use case:** Identifying influential or highly connected nodes in a network.

### 4. `draw_graph_3d(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)`

Creates a 3D visualization of a graph based on its adjacency matrix, with optional highlighting of top nodes.

**Use case:** Visualizing complex network structures in a three-dimensional space.

### 5. `show_bipartite_relationship_with_cosine(adj_matrix)`

Visualizes bipartite relationships in a graph using cosine similarity and community detection algorithms.

**Use case:** Analyzing relationships between different sets of nodes in a bipartite graph.

### 6. `bipartite_matrix_maker(csv_path)`

Reads a CSV file containing a bipartite adjacency matrix and returns it as a list.

**Use case:** Preparing data for analyzing bipartite networks.

## core_rec

```
import core_rec as cs
```
### 1. `recommend_similar_nodes(adj_matrix, node)`

Recommends similar nodes based on cosine similarity scores calculated from the adjacency matrix.

**Use case:** Providing recommendations for nodes based on their similarity within a graph.

### 2. `GraphTransformer(num_layers, d_model, num_heads, d_feedforward, input_dim)`

Defines a Transformer model for graph data with customizable parameters.

**Use case:** Training machine learning models for graph-related tasks, such as node classification or link prediction.

### 3. `GraphDataset(adj_matrix)`

Defines a PyTorch dataset for graph data, allowing easy integration with DataLoader for model training.

**Use case:** Preparing graph data for training machine learning models.

### 4. `train_model(model, data_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs)`

Trains a given model using the provided data loader, loss function, optimizer, and number of epochs.

**Use case:** Training machine learning models for graph-related tasks using graph data.

In the `test.py` file, various functionalities from `vishgraphs.py` and `core_rec.py` are utilized and demonstrated:
- Random graph generation (`generate_random_graph`).
- Identification of top nodes in a graph (`find_top_nodes`).
- Training a Transformer model for graph data (`GraphTransformer`, `GraphDataset`, `train_model`).
- Recommending similar nodes using a trained model (`recommend_similar_nodes`).
- Visualization of a graph in 3D (`draw_graph_3d`).

Feel free to explore the codebase and utilize these functionalities for your graph analysis and recommendation tasks! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy graph analyzing! üìäüîç

### Drawing Graphs
VishGraphs supports drawing graphs in both 2D and 3D:
```python
adj_matrix = vishgraphs.bipartite_matrix_maker(graph_file)
nodes = list(range(len(adj_matrix)))
top_nodes = [0, 1, 2]  # Example top nodes
vishgraphs.draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Generating and Drawing a Random Graph
```python
import vishgraphs

graph_file = vishgraphs.generate_random_graph(10, "random_graph.csv")
adj_matrix = vishgraphs.bipartite_matrix_maker(graph_file)
nodes = list(range(len(adj_matrix)))
top_nodes = [0, 1, 2]  # Example top nodes
vishgraphs.draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)
```
