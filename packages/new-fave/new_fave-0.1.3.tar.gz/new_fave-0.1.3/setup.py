It is philosophically similar (and named after) [the FAVE-suite](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE). However, `new-fave` has been completely written from scratch, and has some key differences from the FAVE-suite.\n\n1. **`new-fave` does not include a forced-aligner.**\n    It can process alignments produced by fave-align, \n    but we would recommend using the Monteal Forced Aligner instead\n2. **`new-fave` does not require speaker demographics.**\n    You can optionally pass `fave-extract` a speaker\n    demographics file to be merged into your formant data,\n    but this does *not* influence how the data is processed\n    in any way. Besides including file name and speaker\n    number data, you can pass *any* demographic information\n    you would like.\n3. **`new-fave` does not assume North American English vowels**.\n    Your alignments can contain any set of vowels, in\n    any transcription system, as long as you can provide \n    a regular expression to identify them.\n4. **`new-fave` is customizable.**\n    With config files, you can customize vowel recoding,\n    labelset parsing, and point measurement heuristics.\n5. **`new-fave` is focused on formant tracks.**\n    You can still produce single point measurements \n    for vowels, but `new-fave` is built upon \n    the [FastTrack](https://fasttrackiverse.github.io/fasttrackpy/) method. By default, it will write \n    output files including point measurements, full\n    formant tracks, and Discrete Cosine Transform \n    coefficients.\n6. **`new-fave` is maintainable**. As time goes on, and the \n    code base needs updating, the organization and \n    infrastructure of `new-fave` should allow it to be\n    readilly updateable.\n\nYou can read more at [the `new-fave` documentation](https://forced-alignment-and-vowel-extraction.github.io/new-fave/).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `new-fave` with `pip`.\n\n```bash\n# bash\npip install new-fave\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the default settings (which assume CMU \ndictionary transcriptions), you can use one of these \npatterns.\n\n### A single audio + textgrid pair\n\n```bash\n# bash\nfave-extract audio-textgrid speaker1.wav speaker1.TextGrid\n```\n\n### A directory of audio + textgrid pairs\n\n```bash\n# bash\nfave-extract corpus speakers/\n```\n\n### Multiple subdirectories of audio + textgrid pairs\n\n```bash\n# bash\nfave-extract subcorpora data/*\n```',
