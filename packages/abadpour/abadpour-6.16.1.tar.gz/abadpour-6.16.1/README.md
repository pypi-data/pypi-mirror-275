# CV

`CV` is an [awesome bash cli](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli) plugin for [my](https://abadpour.com/) CV, in two versions: [compact](https://abadpour-com.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/cv/arash-abadpour-resume.pdf) and [full](https://abadpour-com.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/cv/arash-abadpour-resume-full.pdf).

```bash
 > CV help
CV build [dryrun,~publish,~rm,what=<cv+cv-full>]
 . build CV.
CV clean

```

> ℹ️ a push to this repo triggers a `CV build [publish]`.
