riskparity.py
=============

**riskparity.py** implements fast and scalable algorithms to design risk (budgeting) parity portfolios.
The algorithms are based on the works of Spinu (2013), Griveau-Billion *et. al.* (2013), and Feng & Palomar (2015).

We consider the following optimization problem and its particular cases

.. math::

        \begin{array}{ll}
        \underset{\mathbf{w}}{\textsf{minimize}} &
        R(\mathbf{w}) - \alpha \mathbf{w}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\mu} + \lambda \mathbf{w}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{w}\\
        \textsf{subject to} & \mathbf{C}\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{D}\mathbf{w} \leq \mathbf{d}
        \end{array}

where :math:`R` is a risk concentration function.
