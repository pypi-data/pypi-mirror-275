    """Unified Soil Classification System (USCS).

    The Unified Soil Classification System, initially developed by Casagrande in
    1948 and later modified in 1952, is widely utilized in engineering projects
    involving soils. It is the most popular system for soil classification and is
    similar to Casagrande's Classification System. The system relies on particle
    size analysis and atterberg limits for classification.

    In this system, soils are first classified into two categories:

    - Coarse grained soils: If more than 50% of the soils is retained on No. 200
      (0.075 mm) sieve, it is designated as coarse-grained soil.

    - Fine grained soils: If more than 50% of the soil passes through No. 200 sieve,
      it is designated as fine grained soil.

    Highly Organic soils are identified by visual inspection. These soils are termed
    as Peat. (:math:`P_t`)

    Parameters
    ----------
    liquid_limit : float
        Water content beyond which soils flows under their own weight. It can also
        be defined as the minimum moisture content at which a soil flows upon
        application of a very small shear force.
    plastic_limit : float
        Water content at which plastic deformation can be initiated. It is also the
        minimum water content at which soil can be rolled into a thread 3mm thick
        (molded without breaking)
    fines : float
        Percentage of fines in soil sample i.e. The percentage of soil sample passing
        through No. 200 sieve (0.075mm)
    sand : float
        Percentage of sand in soil sample (%)
    gravel : float
        Percentage of gravel in soil sample (%)
    d_10 : float, mm
        Diameter at which 10% of the soil by weight is finer.
    d_30 : float, mm
        Diameter at which 30% of the soil by weight is finer.
    d_60 : float, mm
        Diameter at which 60% of the soil by weight is finer.
    organic : bool, default=False
        Indicates whether soil is organic or not.

    atterberg_limits : AtterbergLimits
    psd : PSD

    Soil gradation (d_10, d_30, d_60) is needed to obtain soil description for
    certain type of soils.
