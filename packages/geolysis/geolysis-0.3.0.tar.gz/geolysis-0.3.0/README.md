#

`geolysis` is your one-stop shop for all your geotechnical engineering
solutions, ranging from site investigation and laboratory test analysis
to advanced geotechnical designs.

`geolysis` is divided into four (4) main parts:

1. `geolyis.core (Python Package)`

   `geolysis.core` is an open-source Python package that provides features
   for analyzing geotechnical results obtained from field and laboratory
   tests. `geolysis.core` is designed specifically to assist developers
   in building applications that can solve complex geotechnical
   problems.

   Whether you're working on soil mechanics, rock mechanics, or any other
   geotechnical field, `geolysis.core` provides a powerful set of tools
   that can help you design and develop robust solutions. With an
   intuitive API and a wide range of features, this software is an
   essential tool for anyone who needs to work with geotechnical data on
   a regular basis. Whether you're a seasoned geotechnical engineer or a
   new developer just getting started in the field, `geolysis.core` is
   the ideal solution for all your software development needs.

   Some of the features implemented so far include soil classification,
   standard penetration test analysis (such as SPT N-design and SPT
   N-value corrections), and calculating the allowable bearing capacity of
   soils from Standard Penetration Test N-values. There are more features
   underway, which include settlement analysis, ultimate bearing capacity
   analysis, etc.

   `geolysis.core` is the foundation application on which other parts of the
   application will depend. Developers can also use `geolysis.core` to power
   their applications.

1. `geolysis.ui (Qt, PySide6)`

   `geolysis.ui` is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which will enable
   users to graphically interact with `geolysis`. User will be able to
   input data and view generated plots, such as `PSD` curves,
   `Atterberg Limits` plots, `Compaction` curves, etc within the application.

1. `geolysis.excel (Javascript & Others)`

   `geolysis.excel` provides a Microsoft Excel add-in for simple geotechnical
   analysis. _More on this later._

1. `geolysis.ai (Python, Pytorch & Others)`

   `geolysis.ai` explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (**AI**) in
   enhancing productivity in Geotechnical Engineering.

## Motivation

`geolysis` is a software solution that aims to support geotechnical
engineers in their daily work by providing a set of tools that makes
them perform their tasks in a more efficient and effective manner.
Moreover, the platform is designed to educate civil engineering
students, especially those who specialize in geotechnical engineering,
by exposing them to industry-relevant tools and techniques that will
help them become industry-ready professionals as soon as they graduate.
With `geolysis`, users will be better equipped to handle geotechnical
challenges, make informed decisions, and improve their overall
productivity.

## Installation

```shell
pip install geolysis
```

## Getting Started

### Soil Classification Example

AASHTO classification

```python

>>> from geolysis.core.soil_classifier import AASHTO
>>> aashto_cls = AASHTO(liquid_limit=30.2, plasticity_index=6.3, fines=11.18)
>>> aashto_cls.soil_class
'A-2-4(0)'
>>> aashto_cls.soil_desc
'Silty or clayey gravel and sand'

```

USCS Classification

```python

>>> from geolysis.core.soil_classifier import USCS
>>> uscs_cls = USCS(liquid_limit=34.1, plastic_limit=21.1,
...                 fines=47.88, sand=37.84, gravel=14.8)
>>> uscs_cls.soil_class
'SC'
>>> uscs_cls.soil_desc
'Clayey sands'
>>> uscs_cls = USCS(liquid_limit=30.8, plastic_limit=20.7, fines=10.29,
...                 sand=81.89, gravel=7.83, d_10=0.07, d_30=0.3, d_60=0.8)
>>> uscs_cls.soil_class
'SW-SC'
>>> uscs_cls.soil_desc
'Well graded sand with clay'

```
