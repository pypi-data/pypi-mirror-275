# .Net IntelliSense

The .NET IntelliSense Python package is specifically designed to enhance your development experience by providing IntelliSense support for the `with` statement. With this package installed, you can leverage its capabilities to simplify working with system resources in your Python projects. By updating the system stub file, the package ensures that your development environment offers auto-completion and type-aware suggestions for .NET classes that inherit from `System.IDisposable`. This empowers you to write code more efficiently, reducing errors and improving overall productivity.
