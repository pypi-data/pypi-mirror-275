# Sapphire Renderer

Sapphire Renderer is a Python package that allows you to easily render simple 3D scenes. It provides a set of classes and functions to create and manipulate 3D objects, and to render them in a window.

## Features

- **3D Object Creation**: Sapphire Renderer provides classes to create various 3D objects such as Torus, VertLineObject, etc. You can also create your own custom objects.

- **Camera Control**: The package includes a Camera class that allows you to control the viewpoint from which the scene is rendered. You can move and rotate the camera in the 3D space.

- **Object Manipulation**: You can add, remove, and update objects in the scene.

- **Rendering**: The package provides a main rendering loop that continuously updates and renders the scene.

## Installation

You can install Sapphire Renderer using pip:

```bash
pip install sapphire-renderer
```

## Basic Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use Sapphire Renderer:

```python
from sapphirerenderer import SapphireRenderer

# Create a renderer
renderer = SapphireRenderer(width=1000, height=1000, draw_axis=True)

# Add a Torus object to the scene
renderer.add_object("Torus")

# Start the rendering loop
renderer.render_loop()
```

In this example, we first create a SapphireRenderer instance. We then add a Torus object to the scene. Finally, we start the rendering loop which will continuously update and render the scene.
