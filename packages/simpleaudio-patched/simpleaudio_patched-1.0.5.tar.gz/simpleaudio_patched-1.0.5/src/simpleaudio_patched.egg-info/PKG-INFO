This project is forked from https://github.com/cexen/py-simple-audio   which forked it from the original project at  https://github.com/hamiltron/py-simple-audio .
Cexen applied a patch to make the library also work with python3.12. This
repository is mainly used to build wheels for the patched simpleaudio so that we can easily
install it for all python versions on all platforms. This project uses github
actions workflow to build the wheels, and published them under the name
"simpleaudio-patched" on pypi.


NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED
==============================

I no longer have the time to dedicate to maintaining Simpleaudio (which at this point is mostly keeping CI builds working). 
This project should be considered archived, meaning that there will be no further updates or builds. 
For anyone seriously interested in taking over the project, I would be willing to help in that process. 
I would also be willing to revisit maintaining the library should anyone wish to sponsor it. 

Simpleaudio Package
===================

The simplaudio package provides cross-platform, dependency-free audio playback
capability for Python 3 on OSX, Windows, and Linux.
