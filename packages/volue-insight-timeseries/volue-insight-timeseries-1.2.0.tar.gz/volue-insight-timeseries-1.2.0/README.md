# volue-insight-timeseries
Volue Insight API python library for working with timeseries.

This library is meant as a simple toolkit for working with data from
https://api.volueinsight.com/ (or equivalent services). Note that access
is based on having a valid Volue Insight account. Please contact
sales.insight@volue.com in order to get a trial account.

The library is tested against Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 - we recommend using 
the latest Python version.

### Pin this package
We strongly recommend to pin your dependency on our package, since we will do
changes to the package as we introduce new features, fix issues etc. See example
below. At least make sure you lock down the major version in your
requirements.txt file in order to prevent your code to break when we do
breaking changes.

```bash
# your requirements.txt

volue-insight-timeseries==1.0.0 # Good
volue-insight-timeseries # Bad
```

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0-rc.2.html)
principles to communicate the type of change from one version to the next,
together with [release notes](https://github.com/volueinsight/volue-insight-timeseries/releases).

## Migrating from wapi-python
If you previously have used wapi-python, you should switch to use this package
going forward. We will not add any new features to wapi-python, it is only in 
the event of a severe bug that we will do any changes to it.

These are the steps you will have to do in order to successfully
make the switch. 

* Use Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12
* Use Pandas 1.5.0 or newer
* Use [zoneinfo](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html), not pytz for handling time zone information
