                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Introduction

Currently, `ptdeco` implements the following methods:

* **lockd** - method based on local knowledge distillation, tested on vision models
  (lockd = **LOC**al **K**nowledge **D**istillation)

* **falor** - method based on low-rank decomposition of features inspired by [Compressing Transformers: Features Are Low-Rank, but Weights Are Not! by Yu Hao, Wu Jianxin (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i9.26304), tested on vision models
  (falor = **F**eatures **Are** **LO**w **R**ank)

* **dwain** - iterative method based on low-rank decomposition of features, tested on Large Language Models
  (dwain =  **D**ecomposing **W**eights **A**lgorithm - an **I**terative tech**N**ique)

**lockd** method requires short (~ 10 ImageNet epochs) knowledge distillation
pretraining before decomposition is made. It can decompose linear layers and
convolutions.

**falor** method does not require pretraining. Model decomposition lasts < 1
GPU hour (depending on model size and parameters). It can decompose linear
layers and 1x1 convolutions.

**dwain** method does not require pretraining. It can decompose linear layers and
1x1 convolutions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ptdeco
```
## Saving and loading a decomposed model

### Saving a decomposed model

As a result of decomposition you get `decompose_config` dictionary. You need to
serialize this e.g. to JSON. This will let you recreate the structure of a
decomposed model.  Except this, you need to save `state_dict` to recover
the weights of a decomposed model. The code below illustrates the procedure:

```python
import json
import pathlib

# Your decomposition code

output_path = pathlib.Path("YOUR/CHEKCPOINT/DIRECTORY")
out_decompose_config_path = output_path / "decompose_config.json"
with open(out_decompose_config_path, "wt") as f:
    json.dump(decompose_config, f)
out_decompose_state_dict_path = output_path / "decompose_state_dict.pt"
torch.save(model.state_dict(), out_decompose_state_dict_path)
```

### Loading a decomposed model
To load the model, you need to recreate the original model first. Next, you load and apply the
`decompose_config`. Finally, you load the `state_dict` (note the state dict "fits" the
decomposed model, so you need to do it as a last step). The code below illustrates
the procedure:

```python

import json
import pathlib

import ptdeco

model = ... # Build original model
device = ...     # Specify the device original model uses

output_path = pathlib.Path("YOUR/CHEKCPOINT/DIRECTORY")

with open(output_path / "decompose_config.json", "rt") as f:
        decompose_config = json.load(f)

ptdeco.utils.apply_decompose_config_in_place(model, decompose_config)

sd = torch.load(output_path / "decompose_state_dict.pt")

model.load_state_dict(sd, map_location=device)

# Now `model` is decomposed and contains appropriate weights
```
