# プログラムの説明英語で
In this extension, Generative AI generates relevant Visual Effects based on keywords and themes specified by the user.
The user can also customize the size, resolution, and color tone of the generated video, allowing the video to be tailored to a format suitable for a particular platform or device.
This extension allows users to create their desired Visual Effects without photographing the object, and eliminates the need to use advanced techniques to deform shapes or create hand-drawn Visual Effects as animations. 
This reduces work time and makes it possible to create artworks more efficiently.
