    def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):
        """
        Fits the preprocessor to the data and then transforms the data using the fitted preprocessing pipelines. This is a convenience method that combines `fit` and `transform`.

        Parameters:
            X (DataFrame or dict): The input dataset to fit the preprocessor on and then transform.
            y (array-like, optional): The target variable. Required if `use_decision_tree_bins` is True.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary with the transformed data, where keys are the base feature names and values are the transformed features as arrays.

        Returns detailed information about the processed features, including the number of bins for binned features
        and the dimensionality of encoded features. This method is useful for understanding the transformations applied to each feature.

        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple containing two dictionaries, the first with information about binned or ordinal encoded features and
                   the second with information about other encoded features.
