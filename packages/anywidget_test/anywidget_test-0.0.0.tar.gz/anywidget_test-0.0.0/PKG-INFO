# anywidget_test

## Installation

```sh
pip install anywidget_test
```

## Development installation

Create a virtual environment and and install anywidget_test in *editable* mode with the
optional development dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

You then need to install the JavaScript dependencies and run the development server.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `example.ipynb` in JupyterLab, VS Code, or your favorite editor
to start developing. Changes made in `js/` will be reflected
in the notebook.
