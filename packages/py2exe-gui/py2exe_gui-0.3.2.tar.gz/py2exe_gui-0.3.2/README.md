## Introduction

Py2exe-GUI is an assist tool based on [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html), designed to provide a
complete yet easy-to-use GUI for [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/).

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muziing/Py2exe-GUI/main/docs/source/images/Py2exe-GUI_v0.3.1_mainwindow_screenshot_en.png)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muziing/Py2exe-GUI/main/docs/source/images/Py2exe-GUI_v0.2.0_screenshot.png)

It has the following features:

- Fully graphical interface, easy to use.
- All options of PyInstaller will be supported.
- You can invoke any local Python interpreter with its corresponding environment, eliminating the need to reinstall it in each interpreter environment to be packaged.
- Cross-platform, supports Windows, Linux and macOS.

## How to install

> Note: Py2exe-GUI is still in the early stages of development, and the distributions provided are *beta versions*.
> Installation methods may change frequently, so be sure to check these instructions often.

### Option A: Install with `pip`

First, install PyInstaller in the Python interpreter environment which to be packaged:

```shell
pip install pyinstaller  # Must be installed in your project environment
```

Then install Py2exe-GUI with `pip`:

```shell
pip install py2exe-gui  # Can be installed into any environment
```

Run:

```shell
py2exe-gui
```

You can run py2exe-gui as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:

```shell
python -m py2exe_gui  # `_`, not `-`
```

### Option B: Run through source code

For those who like to try it out or are in desperate need of the latest bug fixes, you can run it through the repository source code:

1. Download the [latest main branching source code](https://codeload.github.com/muziing/Py2exe-GUI/zip/refs/heads/main).

2. Unzip it and go to the directory. Launch a terminal to create and activate the virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv  # create a virtual environment (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1  # and activate it (Windows, PowerShell)
    ```

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv venv  # create a virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
    source venv/bin/activate  # and activate it (Linux/macOS)
    ```

3. Install dependencies and run the program.

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python ./src/Py2exe-GUI.py
    ```
