> ℹ️ _This package is still under development and some functionalities may change in the future._

This is a python package for time-explicit Life Cycle Assessment that helps you assess the environmental impacts of products and processes over time. `timex_lca` builds on top of the [Brightway LCA framework](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest).

## Features:
This package enables you to account for: 
- **Timing of processes** throughout the supply chain (e.g., end-of-life treatment occurs 20 years after construction)
- **Variable** and/or **evolving** supply chains & technologies (e.g., increasing shares of renewable electricity in the future)
- **Timing of emissions** (by applying dynamic characterization functions)

You can define temporal distributions for process and emission exchanges, which are then *automatically* propagated through the supply chain and mapped to corresponding time-explicit databases. The resulting time-explicit LCI reflects the current technology status within the production system at the actual time of each process. Also, `timex_lca` keeps track of the timing of emissions which means that you can apply dynamic characterization functions.

## Use cases:
`timex_lca` is ideal for cases with:
- **Variable** or strongly **evolving production systems**
- **Long-lived** products
- **Biogenic** carbon
