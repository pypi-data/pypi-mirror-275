sigcalc
=======

Sigcalc is a python module for expressing quantities with significant
figures and performing calculations on quantities based on the rules
of significant figures.

Installation
------------

Install sigcalc with pip::

  pip install sigcalc

or with poetry::

  poetry add sigcalc

``sigcalc`` depends on the internal ``decimal``
`module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html>`_
for arithmetic and `mpmath <https://mpmath.org/>`_ for transcendental
and other functions.

Usage
-----

Import the ``Quantity`` class:

>>> from sigcalc import Quantity
>>> from decimal import getcontext
>>> getcontext().prec = 28

Create ``Quantity`` objects as necessary:

>>> a = Quantity("3.14", "3")
>>> b = Quantity("2.72", "3")

The precision of the underlying ``decimal`` context should adjust
automatically to contain the number of digits specified or the number
of significant figures, within the limits of the ``decimal`` module.

Arithmetic for ``Quantity`` objects is implemented on the usual magic
methods:

>>> from sigcalc import Quantity
>>> from decimal import getcontext
>>> from decimal import ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> getcontext().prec = 28
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> a = Quantity("3.14", "3")
>>> b = Quantity("2.72", "3")
>>> a + b
Quantity("5.86", "3")
>>> a - b
Quantity("0.42", "2")
>>> a * b
Quantity("8.5408", "3")
>>> a / b
Quantity("1.154411764705882352941176471", "3")
>>> abs(a)
Quantity("3.14", "3")
>>> -a
Quantity("-3.14", "3")
>>> +a
Quantity("3.14", "3")

Beware that rounding is not performed during calculations and that
reported significant figures for calculated values are for the
unrounded value.  For example, a calculation that resulted in a result
of ``Quantity("99.9", "3")`` could round to ``Quantity("100.0",
"4")``, depending on the current rounding mode.

Note that ``__floordiv__`` is not implemented as it is not useful for
significant figures calculations.

>>> a // b
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'Quantity' and 'Quantity'

Comparisons behave as expected for real numbers, with the exception
equality and significance.  Since quantities with different
significance have different meanings, they are not equal as quantity
objects:

>>> from sigcalc import Quantity
>>> a = Quantity("3.135", "3")
>>> b = Quantity("3.135", "4")
>>> c = Quantity("3.145", "3")
>>> a == a
True
>>> a == b
False
>>> a != b
True
>>> a < b
False
>>> a <= b
False

Rounding affects comparisons as well:

>>> from decimal import ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> from decimal import ROUND_HALF_UP
>>> from decimal import getcontext
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> a < c
False
>>> a == c
True
>>> a <= c
True
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_UP
>>> a < c
True
>>> a == c
False
>>> a <= c
True

Rounding and output are tied together.  Typically, rounding is
unnecessary except for output but is available:

>>> a = Quantity("3.14", "2")
>>> a.round()
Quantity("3.1", "2")
>>> a
Quantity("3.14", "2")

Rounding constants has no effect:

>>> a = Quantity("3.145", "3", constant=True)
>>> a.round()
Quantity("3.145", "28", constant=True)

String output uses the underlying ``decimal`` module's string output
after rounding to the correct significant figures:

>>> from decimal import ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> from decimal import ROUND_HALF_UP
>>> from decimal import getcontext
>>> a = Quantity("3.145", "3")
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_UP
>>> str(a)
'3.15'
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> str(a)
'3.14'

The rounding mode is controlled by the ``decimal`` module contexts and
context managers.  The default rounding mode for the ``decimal``
module is ``decimal.ROUND_HALF_EVEN`` while the rounding used in most
textbook discussions of significant figures is
``decimal.ROUND_HALF_UP``, so beware.

Likewise with formatting:

>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_UP
>>> format(a, ".2e")
'3.15e+0'
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_EVEN
>>> format(b, ".2e")
'3.14e+0'

Power and Square Root Functions
...............................

The power and square root (``__pow__()`` and ``sqrt()``) functions and
are implemented as wrappers around the appropriate functions from
``decimal.Decimal``, calculating results based on the ``value`` of a
``Quantity`` combined with the correct significant figures, following
the "significance in, significance out" rule for both functions.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
.....................................

The exponential and logarithmic (``exp()``, ``exp10()``, ``ln()``, and
``log10()``) functions are implemented as wrappers around the
corresponding functions from ``decimal`` to calculate the ``value`` of
a ``Quantity`` combined with the correct significant figures.
Abscissa digits are treated as placeholders so a logarithm will
increase significance by the number of significant abscissa digits;
exponentials will decrease the significance by the number of
significant abscissa digits.  Consequently, if a ``Quantity`` has
significant figures less than or equal to the number of abscissa
digits, a ``RuntimeWarning`` will be raised and a ``Quantity`` with
zero significant figures will be returned.  See the references for
more information.

Transcendental Functions
........................

The transcendental functions and their inverses are implemented as
wrappers around the appropriate functions from ``mpmath``, calculating
results based on the ``value`` of a ``Quantity`` combined with the
correct significant figures, following the "significance in,
significance out" rule.

Hyperbolic Functions
....................

The hyperbolic functions and their inverses are implemented as
wrappers around the appropriate functions from ``mpmath``, calculating
results based on the ``value`` of a ``Quantity`` combined with the
correct significant figures, following the "significance in,
significance out" rule.

`module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html>`_,
the `mpmath <https://mpmath.org/>`_ library, and the
`hypothesis <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/>`_ testing library,
without which, this would be a much smaller and less functional
library.

Remember, calculating with significant figures is not a substitute for
repetition of measurements and proper statistical analysis.
