# DATA-TESTING-PACKAGE

The data testing package is supported for both Unix-like and Windows OS. The purpose of this repo is to combine all methods that are commonly used for data testing into a single package. 

First, we need to create the virtual environment and install dependencies.
we will be using poetry to manage all our dependencies. 
to install poetry run `pip install poetry`

to create a virtual environment run `poetry install`

To activate virtual environment run `poetry shell`

To come out of your virtual environment run `deactivate`
