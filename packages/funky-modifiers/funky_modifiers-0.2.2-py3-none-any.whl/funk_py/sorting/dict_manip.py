    """
    Handles the conversion of data structured as either a dictionary or a list containing key-value
    pairs into a dictionary representation. The conversion process adheres to specific rules based
    on the following criteria:

    1. If ``pair_name`` is specified.
    2. If both ``key_name`` **and** ``val_name`` are specified.
        *Be aware that specifying only one of these will result in both being ignored.*
    3. If ``key_name`` is equal to ``val_name`` and both are specified.

    When ``pair_name`` is specified and ``key_name``, ``val_name``, or both are missing, the
    function conducts a depth-first search to locate a dictionary containing ``pair_name`` as a key.
    It traverses through lists and their nested lists to find the desired pairs. If a dictionary
    with ``pair_name`` as a key is found, the function inspects the corresponding value. If the
    value is a list, it identifies the lowest-level lists within it and constructs pairs using the
    :func:`~merge_tuplish_pair` function. If successful, this process is repeated for other lists.
    If elements in the list are dictionaries with only one key, the function delves deeper into
    them following the same search pattern.

    When both ``key_name`` and ``val_name`` are specified but ``pair_name`` is not, the search
    method depends on whether ``key_name`` equals ``val_nam``. If they are equal, the function
    performs the same search as it would for ``pair_name`` but searches for ``key_name`` instead.
    If they are unequal, it searches for a dictionary containing both ``key_name`` and ``val_name``
    in the same manner as for ``pair_name``. Once the target dictionary is found, the function
    evaluates only one pair from it. If the value under ``key_name`` is a list, it iterates
    through it to ensure there are no un-hashable values within, then constructs the pair using
    :func:`~merge_tuplish_pair`. This process is repeated for as many pairs as it can find.

    When ``pair_name``, ``key_name``, and ``val_name`` are all specified, the search method is the
    same as for ``pair_name`` until a dictionary containing ``pair_name`` is found. Once such a
    dictionary is found, the same process as when `key_name` and ``val_name`` are specified is
    attempted on the value under the ``pair_name`` key.

    If neither ``pair_name``, ``key_name``, nor ``val_name`` is specified, the search method
    attempts to find each lowest-level list just as it normally would when ``pair_name`` is the only
    value specified.

    .. note::
        When attempting to find a dictionary containing target key(s) :func:`convert_tuplish_dict`
        will stop at dictionaries containing more than one key if they do not contain the target
        key.

    :type data: Union[dict, list]
    :param pair_name: The name used to represent a pair. If omitted, will not expect pairs to be
        under keys.

        neither will be used and pairs will be constructed using the best identifiable method.
    :type key_name: str
    :param val_name: The name used to represent a value. If either this or ``key_name`` is omitted,
        neither will be used and pairs will be constructed using the best identifiable method.

    :return: A flat dictionary made of key-value pairs found in the given data.

    .. note::
        Please be aware that the returned dictionary may not be completely flat, as there is a
        chance of a value being under a path of keys.
