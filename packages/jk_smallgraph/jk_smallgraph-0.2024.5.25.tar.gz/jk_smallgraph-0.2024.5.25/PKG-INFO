==========

Introduction
------------

This python module is a directed graph implementation where each node and edges is represented as an individual object.

This implementation is not intended to represent large graphs. For this purpose, this implementation may not
be good enough. This is not the purpose of this module. This module provides objects for nodes and edges for
you to attach data to. The focus is on intuitive representation and management of your data,
not on maximum possible performance.
