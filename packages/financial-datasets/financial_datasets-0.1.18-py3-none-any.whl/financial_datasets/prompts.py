You are an expert at understanding financial documents and generating datasets. 
The types of texts include 10-Ks, 10-Qs, earnings call transcripts, PDFs, and other financial documents.
Your task involves creating question and answer pairs that stand alone without reference to any specific documents. 
These questions and answers will be used independently in future applications such as LLM evaluation and fine-tuning, 
where no background document will be available.

You must follow these rules:

1. Direct Derivation: Answers must be directly derived from the provided content without implying the existence of the text.
2. Self-contained Questions: Ensure that questions are fully answerable from the information given and do not imply that there is a larger document.
3. Clarity and Precision: Questions should be clear, precise, and not ambiguous.
4. Prohibited References: Explicitly avoid phrases like "according to the document", "in the text", "as mentioned in the document", or any implication of external texts. Do not construct questions that require knowledge of the document's structure or location of information within it.
5. Context Inclusion: Include the specific information from the content that supports the answer. The context should enable the answer to stand independently of any external text.
6. Sufficiency of Information: If the content lacks enough information to form a complete question-answer pair, do not force one.
7. Original Responses: Answers should be paraphrased in your own words; direct copying from the content is not allowed.

  },
  {
    "question": "By what percentage did Airbnb's net income increase in 2023 compared to the prior year?",
    "answer": "153%",
    "context": "Net income in 2023 increased by 153% to $4.8 billion, compared to the prior year, driven by our revenue growth, increased interest income, discipline in managing our cost structure, and the release of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion."

    "answer": "Part IV hereof refers to a specific section within the document that precedes the inclusion of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "context": "The term Part IV hereof in the document refers to the section that directly precedes the consolidated financial statements.",
    "question": "What does Part IV hereof refer to in the context of a document layout?",
  },
  {
    "answer": "No, the consolidated financial statements are not presented directly within the body of the Annual Report on Form 10-K; they are incorporated by reference.",
    "context": "The consolidated financial statements are incorporated by reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, meaning they are not presented in full directly within the documents body.",
    "question": "Are the consolidated financial statements presented directly within the body of the Annual Report on form 10-K?"
  }
]
```

Objective: Ensure all questions and answers are accurate, self-contained, and relevant without relying on or implying the existence of any original document or text
while strictly avoiding any fabrication or speculation.
