# Financial Datasets ðŸ§ª

Financial Datasets is an open-source Python library
that lets you create question & answer financial datasets
using Large Language Models (LLMs). With this library,
you can easily generate realistic financial datasets from a 10-K,
10-Q, PDF, and other financial texts.

## Usage

**Example generated dataset:**

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What was Airbnb's revenue in 2023?",
    "answer": "$9.9 billion",
    "context": "In 2023, revenue increased by 18% to $9.9 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to a 14% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 54.5 million combined with higher average daily rates driving a 16% increase in Gross Booking Value of $10.0 billion."
  },
  {
    "question": "By what percentage did Airbnb's net income increase in 2023 compared to the prior year?",
    "answer": "153%",
    "context": "Net income in 2023 increased by 153% to $4.8 billion, compared to the prior year, driven by our revenue growth, increased interest income, discipline in managing our cost structure, and the release of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion."
  }
]
```

**Example #1 - generate from any text**

Most flexible option. Generates dataset using a list of string `texts`. Colab code
example [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/virattt/f9b5a0ae82cc0caab57df5dedc2927c9/intro-financial-datasets.ipynb).

```python
from financial_datasets.generator import DatasetGenerator

# Your list of texts
texts = ...

# Create dataset generator
generator = DatasetGenerator(model="gpt-4-turbo", api_key="your-openai-key")

# Generate dataset from texts
dataset = generator.generate_from_texts(
    texts=texts,
    max_questions=100,
)
```

**Example #2 - generate from PDF**

Generate a dataset using a PDF `url` only. Colab code
example [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/virattt/b04442ee7c6c0d0bb3c9371af2283a20/intro-financial-datasets.ipynb).

```python
from financial_datasets.generator import DatasetGenerator

# Create dataset generator
generator = DatasetGenerator(model="gpt-4-turbo", api_key="your-openai-key")

# Generate dataset from PDF url
dataset = generator.generate_from_pdf(
    url="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2023ltr.pdf",
    max_questions=100,
)
```

**Example #3 - generate from 10-K**

Generate a dataset using a `ticker` and `year`. Colab code
example [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/virattt/743872e143034987d20e6a6c7bb9d0a1/intro-financial-datasets.ipynb).

```python
from financial_datasets.generator import DatasetGenerator

# Create dataset generator
generator = DatasetGenerator(model="gpt-4-turbo", api_key="your-openai-key")

# Generate dataset from 10-K
dataset = generator.generate_from_10K(
    ticker="AAPL",
    year=2023,
    max_questions=100,
    item_names=["Item 1", "Item 7"],  # optional - specify Item names to use
)
```
