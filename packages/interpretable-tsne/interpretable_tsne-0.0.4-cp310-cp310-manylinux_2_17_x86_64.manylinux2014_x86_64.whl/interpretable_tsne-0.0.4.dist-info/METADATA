Interpretable t-SNE
===================

`interpretable_tsne` is an implementation of our gradient-based attributiont technique described in our GLBIO oral presentation: 'Towards Computing Attributions for Dimensionality Reduction Techniques'. 

To replicate the experiments we performed in our presentation, go to: [MattScicluna/interpretable_tsne_experiment](https://github.com/MattScicluna/interpretable_tsne_experiment)

Synthetic data experiment demonstrating that our t-SNE attributions can identify the ground truth significant features. See [our pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.12.540592v1) for more details.
