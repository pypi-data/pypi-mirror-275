Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before diving into OpynGPT, ensure you have the following prerequisites
installed:

-  Python 3.x
-  The ``requests`` library (Install using ``pip install requests``)

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing OpynGPT is as simple as running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install opyngptchat

To install the latest version from the GitHub repository, use:

.. code:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/devout-coder/OpynGPT.git

Usage
-----

OpynGPT in python applications is straightforward and easy.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here’s a quick guide to get you started:

1. Import the ``prompt`` function from the OpynGPT module:

.. code:: python

   from opyngptchat import prompt

2. Use the ``prompt`` function to generate natural language responses
   based on your input:

.. code:: python

   user_input = "Write a factorial code in Python."
   response = prompt(user_input)
   print(response)

OpynGPT will process your input and return a relevant response,
empowering you to integrate language models into your projects
seamlessly.

OpynGPT Command Line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interactive Mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enter the interactive mode, simply open your terminal and type
``opyngptchat``. Then you can enter your messages and receive responses
interactively. Type ``exit`` or press ``Ctrl+C`` to quit the interactive
mode.

Example:

::

   $ opyngptchat
   Enter your message (type 'exit' to quit): Hello, how are you?
   [OpynGPT]: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?
   Enter your message (type 'exit' to quit): What is the capital of France?
   [OpynGPT]: The capital of France is Paris.
   Enter your message (type 'exit' to quit): exit

Single Query:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a single query, use ``opyngptchat "your query"`` in your terminal,
replacing ``"your query"`` with your actual query.

Example:

.. code:: bash

   $ opyngptchat "What is the capital of Japan?"
   [OpynGPT]: The capital of Japan is Tokyo.
