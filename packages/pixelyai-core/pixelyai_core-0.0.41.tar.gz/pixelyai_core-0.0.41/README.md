Here's a simple use case of PixelyAI Chat and RAG Agents

```python
from pixelyai_core import PixelClient

client = PixelClient(
    "http://127.0.0.1:7860/"
)
# in case that contexts is None the RAG agent won't be used

contexts = None

# Using RAG Agent with contexts be Like

contexts = [
    (
        "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris,"
        " France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed"
        " and built the tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's "
        "Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for "
        "its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable"
        " structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 "
        "million people ascended it in 2015. The tower is 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height "
        "as an 81-story building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 meters"
        " (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become "
        "the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New "
        "York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 meters. Due"
        " to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler"
        " Building by 5.2 meters (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing "
        "structure in France after the Millau Viaduct."
    ),
    (
        "The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels."
        " The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground â€“ the highest observation"
        " deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by "
        "stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level "
        "is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase"
        " to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift."
