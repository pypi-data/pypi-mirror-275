## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
Here's how to install and add the plugin to mov-cli.

1. Install the pip package.
```sh
pip install mov-cli-files
```
2. Then add the plugin to your mov-cli config.
```sh
mov-cli -e
```
```toml
[mov-cli.plugins]
files = "mov-cli-files"
```

## Usage üñ±Ô∏è
```sh
mov-cli -s files {query}
```

### Example üåü
Let's say I want to play an mp4 file in my Videos folder named "osaka_america_ya.mp4", this is the command you can use:
```sh
mov-cli -s files america ya
```

### Search in literal path üîé
If you would like to quickly search in a path that is not scanned by the plugin use the ``path`` scraper option like so:
```sh
mov-cli -s files osaka oh my gah -- --path ./Downloads
```

### Give me EVERYTHING ‚ú¥Ô∏è
If you would like to search for everything use the star chatacter (``*``) instead of entering a query like so:
```sh
mov-cli -s files "*"
```
