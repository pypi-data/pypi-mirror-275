slope:
	formula:
		z = multipliers
		y = share prices
		
		= delta_z / delta_y 
		
		= (z2 - z1)
		  ---
		  (y2 - y1)
		  
	priorities, the slopes of the line from:
		
		1. 0 to the break even, this always = 0
		
		2. break even to infinity


		example:
			[{
				"strike price": Fraction (7.5),
				"option price": Fraction (0.15),
			},
			{
				"strike price": Fraction (5),
				"option price": Fraction (0.3)
			},
			{
				"strike price": Fraction (2.5),
				"option price": Fraction (3.2),
			}]
			
			index 0:
				strike price: 7.5
				option price: 0.15
				
				break even: 7.65

				0 to break even: (0 - 0) / 
				
				break even to infinity:
					break even + 1:
						multiplier
							= (share_price - strike_price) / expense
							= (8.65 - 7.5) / 0.15
							= 1.15 / 0.15
							= 23/3
							= 7 2/3
							
						slope = (23/3 - 0) / (8.65 - 7.65)
						slope = (23/3) / 1
						slope = 23/3
						
					break even + 2:
						multiplier
							= (share_price - strike_price) / expense
							= (9.65 - 7.5) / 0.15
							= 2.15 / 0.15
							= 43/3
						
						slope = (43/3 - 23/3) / (9.65 - 8.65)
						slope = (20/3) / 1
						slope = 20/3
