		This calculates the sum of every call option for a symbol 
		or "symbol and expiration".
		
		It also calculates the sum of every put option for a symbol 
		or "symbol and expiration".
		
		The it calculates the ratio of the call sums to the put sums.
		
		

		for each contract:
			summation (
				contract price * 
				open interest * 
				shares per contract
			)

			calculates the sum and ratios of:

			for one expiration:
				summation (ask value of every call) : summation (ask value of every put)
				summation (bid value of every call) : summation (bid value of every put)
				summation (last value of every call) : summation (last value of every put)
			
			for every expiration:
				summation (ask value of every call) : summation (ask value of every put)
				summation (bid value of every call) : summation (bid value of every put)
				summation (last value of every call) : summation (last value of every put)
