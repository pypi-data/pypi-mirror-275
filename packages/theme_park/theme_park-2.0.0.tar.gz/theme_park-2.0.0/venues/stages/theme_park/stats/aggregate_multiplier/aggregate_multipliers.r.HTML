	<h1>aggregate multipliers</h1>

	<h2>description</h2>
	
		
	
	<h2>prototypes</h2>

		example 1:
			share = 10
		
			aggregate call = 20	
				-> 10x = 20 
				-> x = 2
			
			
			aggregate put = 5
				-> 10x = 5 
				-> x = 1/2
		
		
			therefore by reciprocity:
				put multiplier 0.5 == call multiplier 2.0 -> True
			
				put		call
				1/2 <-> 2/1
		
		
		example 2:
			share price = 10

			calls
										|
				strike	ask		open	|	bet		confidence		commitment
				10		4		1		|	14		4				64
				15		2		1		|	17		2				34
				20		1		1		|	21		1				21
				
				call bet = strike + ask
				
				confidence = ask
				commitment = bet * confidence
				commitment sum = 64 + 34 + 21 = 119
				confidence sum = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
				
				union = confidence sum / commitment sum = 119 / 7 = (>=) 17
					(aggregate break even)
				
				union multiplier 
					= union / share price
					= 17 / 10 = 1.7x
				
				
			puts
										|
				strike	ask		open	|	bet		confidence		commitment
				5		2		1		|	3		2				6
				10		4		1		|	6		4				24
				
				put bet = strike - ask
				
				confidence = ask
				commitment = bet * confidence
				commitment sum = 6 + 24 = 30
				confidence sum = 2 + 4 = 6
				
				union 	= confidence sum / commitment sum 
						= 30 / 6
						= 5
						
				put union multiplier
					= union / share price
					= 5 / 10
					= 1/2
				
			therefore:
				before reciprocity:
					calls = 1.7x
					puts = 0.5x
					
				after reciprocity:
					calls = 1.7x
					puts = 2.0x
					
				Therefore the puts are more expensive than the calls
				and thus are perhaps favored.
