	with input as a list of dicts, 
	that adds ATR and atr to the dicts in the input list,
	and the input values are "high", "low", and "end",
	with the licensing info written as a comment?
	where the name of the def is calculate_ATR

	Where the license says:

	"This work is subject to the terms of this custom license that is a fork of the MIT license."
	Where the license is a custom version of the MIT license
