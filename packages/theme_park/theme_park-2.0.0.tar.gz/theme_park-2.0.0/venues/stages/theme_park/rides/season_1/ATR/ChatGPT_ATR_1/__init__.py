Can you provide me with
the ATR formula in python3 without pandas 
with input as a list of dicts, 
that adds ATR and atr to the dicts in the input list,
and the input values are "high", "low", and "close",
with the licensing info written as a comment?
where the name of the def is calculate_ATR

Where the license says:
"copyright ChatGPT and OpenAI"
"This work is subject to the terms of this custom license that is a fork of the MIT license."
Where the license is a custom version of the MIT license
that doesn't use any all caps writing?

After the license can you say, "These licensing terms were provided as per an ask."

And can you please reference any sources utilized?
