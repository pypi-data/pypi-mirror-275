## <ins>Project overview</ins>

Welcome to **Chrfinder**! This project **automates the selection of the most suitable chromatography** technique . By simply providing the **names** of the molecules in the mixture, the code retrieves their physicochemical properties from **PubChem** (web source) and determines the optimal chromatography method based on these properties. It also gives the optimal conditions.

## ‚úÖ <ins>Benefits</ins>

- **üöÄ Efficiency**: Automates the property retrieval and decision-making process, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **üéØ Accuracy**: Utilizes precise physicochemical data to ensure the most suitable chromatography technique is chosen.
- **üåê Versatility**: Supports a wide range of organic compounds and chromatography methods (PubChem database).


## ‚öô <ins>Installation</ins>

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```bash
conda create -n chrfinder python=3.10 
```

```bash
conda activate chrfinder
pip install Chrfinder
```

## üõ†Ô∏è <ins>Installation for Development</ins>

To get started with Chrfinder, you can follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Averhv/Chrfinder.git
cd Chrfinder
pip install .
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```
#### Optional: Installing for Development and Testing
If you want to contribute to Chrfinder or run the tests and get coverage, you can install the package in editable mode along with the necessary dependencies for testing and documentation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Averhv/Chrfinder.git
cd Chrfinder
pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

Then you need to run the tests as follow in your terminal:
```bash
pip install tox
tox
```
One can also run the following to get better **readability**:
- runs tests for the Chrfinder.py file
- measures code coverage
- generates coverage reports in both XML and terminal formats
- provides verbose output during test execution.
```bash
pytest --cov=src/Chrfinder.py --cov-report xml:.tox/coverage.xml --cov-report term -vv
```
Test result: 15 passed in ~20s
## üìí <ins>Features</ins>

```python
from chrfinder import main

# Running the whole file ask for molecules through Tkinter and returns the best chromatography
main()
```

#### üåê Optional functions

##### find_pka(inchikey)
Finds the pKa value for a compound using its InChIKey.
```python
from chrfinder import find_pka

inchikey = "XEFQLINVKFYRCS-UHFFFAOYSA-N"
find_pka(inchikey)
```

##### find_boiling_point(name)
Finds the boiling point for a compound by name.
```python
from chrfinder import find_boiling_point

compound_name = "Ethanol"
find_boiling_point(compound_name)
```

##### get_df_properties()
Get a DataFrame of properties for a mixture of compounds.
```python
from chrfinder import get_df_properties

mixture = ["Acetone", "Ethanol", "Methanol"]
get_df_properties(mixture, verbose=True)
```

## <ins>How It Works</ins>

1. **Input**: User provides the names of the molecules present in the mixture through a Tkinter interface.

2. **Data Retrieval**: Finds the following key physicochemical properties for each molecule in Pubchem:
     - **Boiling temperature (¬∞C)**
     - **logP (partition coefficient)**
     - **pKa (acid dissociation constants)**
     - **Molecular mass**

3. **Chromatography Type Decision**: Follows logical conditions to determine best chromatography and conditions
   - **Gas Chromatography (GC)**: if the Boiling Point is low (T<sub>eb</sub> <250¬∞C).
   - **Ion Chromatography (IC)**: for small molecules (M<2000g/mol) and a negative maximum LogP negative
     - Selected if the maximum molecular mass is less than or equal to 2000, and the maximum logP is negative, with a proposed pH derived from the pKa values.
   - **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)**: Chosen for different conditions. Stationary phases and eluent natures are suggested.
   - **Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)**: For big molecules (M>2000g/mol). From LogP, it suggest gel permeation or gel filtration, with corresponding eluant.

4. **Output**:
   - The code outputs the advisable chromatography type, the nature of the eluent (gas, aqueous, or organic), and the proposed pH for the eluent if applicable through the Tkinter interface.
  
## <ins>Work in progress...</ins>
- Build a data molecules thermostability database;
- taking into account multiple pKa values for polyacids for exemple;
- optimize the research: search only one time te same name;
- find physicalchemical properties as addition functionality;
