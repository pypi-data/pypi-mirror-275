# ephysworking

This repository contains a selection of general scripts by Joe Ziminski
for working on ephys at the SWC. Once useful features here are
develloped enough they will be proposed as additions to
[SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface).

Contact Joe Ziminski on Slack (SWC Users) or at j.ziminski@ucl.ac.uk
