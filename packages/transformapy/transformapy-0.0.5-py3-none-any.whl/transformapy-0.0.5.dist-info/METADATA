transformapy: A Toolkit for Identifying Transformation Product Structures of Emerging Contaminants Using HRMS Data
==================================================================================================================

transformapy is a Python toolkit engineered to process molecular structures, pinpointing potential transformation products of specified compounds by leveraging observed monoisotopic masses.

Contributor: Rui Wang
=====================

First release date: Feb.28.2024

Update
======

April.09.2024: transformapy 0.0.5

1. **Updated `remove_2H` Function**: Modifications have been made to improve the performance and accuracy of the `remove_2H` function.
2. **New Helper Functions**: Added `check_bad_valance_Hidx` and `remove_additional_H` functions, which are now utilized internally by `remove_2H` to enhance its functionality.
3. **Added `add_missing_H` Function**: Introduced a new function to automatically add missing hydrogen atoms to molecules to correct their valency.
4. **Enhanced `reaction_type` Checks**: Integrated the `add_missing_H` and `remove_additional_H` functions into the `reaction_type` function to ensure molecule structures are correctly adjusted during reactions.
5. **Introduced `stepwise_reaction` Function**: A new function to facilitate the stepwise application of reaction steps on a target molecule, allowing more detailed control over complex reaction pathways.
6. **Improvements to `generate_possible_TP_structures`**: Significant updates have been made to this function to optimize the generation of possible transformation product structures based on modified chemical reaction processes.
