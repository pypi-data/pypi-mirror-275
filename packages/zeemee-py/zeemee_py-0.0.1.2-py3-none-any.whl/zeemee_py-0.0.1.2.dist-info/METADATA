------ Following set up to be replicated in redshift_data_team_table_updated folder code and then code below 
------ to be deprecated

- data_team_etl: 
     Contains Athena table update code. Each table has its own folder. This is the logical sequence of functions in each folder:
     
     calculate_values > create_one_school_data > process_for_config_schools > perform_athena_update 
          
     These functions are combined in main_stitch function and this main stitch function are to be run through a file named launch_xxxxx . This ensure local changes are picked up by cron job without the need to recreate the job. This is an Rstudio issue.
     Each folder has the above logical sequence of functions for following cases. We will use all_partner_data_part1 (ap1) as the example to show those cases-
     - ap1
     - ap1_by_gender
     - ap1_for_old_cohort
     - ap1_by_gender_for_old_cohort
     - ap1_for_single_file (to be added)
     
     We decided to keep the table update code separately in each table folder as each table could have different basis for joining/deleting rows. At present, we only have org table that doesn't use student_type and start_term to join/filter data. But we could have more such cases in future
     
     We don't consider gender while deleting rows while updating the table. This is because we should be deleting all gender rows related to a specific school and replace them with new gender rows everytime. We shouldn't delete a specific gender row for a specific school and update just that. 
     
Additions planned:
- old cohort data (move old_cohort_data folder under data-team so backfill and old cohort update code will also be tracked)
- zeemee_analytics/ data_analytics (this will have code related to daily analytics update like slack webhook in comms channel, dashboard email code, etc)
- full_pipeline code (this section will need some clean up before we add it to it. Ensure .gitignore is properly updated for big files and sensitive data)
