            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
        
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
        
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
        
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
        
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Python aTLS Package

An implementation of Attested TLS (aTLS) for Python.

Supports the client-side handshake against a custom attester that issues JWT
tokens via the Azure Attestation Service (AAS) running on Azure Container
Instance (ACI) instances.

For the moment, this package exists to support
[`OpaquePrompts`](https://pypi.org/project/opaqueprompts/), a confidential
information redaction service that runs in a Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE).

**API Stability:** This package is still in development. As such, its API may
change until it is sufficiently mature.

**Note:** The server-side counterpart to this package is not yet public. If you
are interested in using the aTLS functionality in this package, please reach out
by filing an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/opaque-systems/atls-python/).

## Overview

Confidential computing is an emerging field focused on protecting data not only
at rest and in transit, but also during use.

Typically, the security of a service running in the cloud depends on the
security and trustworthiness of the cloud fabric it is hosted on and of the
entity that provides the service. Additionally, there is no way for a user of
such a service to ascertain, with cryptographic proof, that the service they are
using really is the service they expect in terms of the very code that the
service runs.

In contrast to traditional service deployments, with confidential computing one
relies on Trusted Execution Environments, or TEEs. A TEE provides guarantees of
confidentiality and integrity of code and data as well as a mechanism for remote
entities to appraise its trustworthiness known as remote attestation, all rooted
in hardware.

During remote attestation, the user of a service running inside a TEE challenges
the service to produce evidence of its trustworthiness. This evidence includes
measurements of the hosting environment, including hardware, firmware, and
software stack that the service is running on, as well as measurements of the
service itself. In turn, these measurements are produced in such a way that they
are as trustworthy as the manufacturer of the TEE itself (e.g., Intel or AMD).

Perhaps most crucially, TEEs and remote attestation can be used to create
services that run in such a way that neither the cloud fabric nor the service
owner can neither access nor tamper with the service. That is, users of the
service may convince themselves through remote attestation that any data that
they share with the service will be shielded from the cloud fabric and also from
the service provider.

This package aims to implement remote attestation for various TEEs in Python.

## Design

The main workhorse of this package is the `ATLSContext` class. Instances of this
class are parameterized with one or more `Validator`s. A `Validator` can
understand and appraise evidence or attestation results issued by an attester or
verifier, respectively, contained in an attestation document created by an
issuer, itself embedded in a TLS certificate.

The appraisal of an attestation document takes the place of the typical
PKI-based certificate validation performed during regular TLS. By appraising an
attestation document via `Validator`s, the `ATLSContext` class binds the TLS
handshake not to a PKI-backed entity but to a genuine TEE.

## Sample Usage

The following snippet demonstrates how to use this package, assuming a service
running on a confidential ACI instance with the corresponding attestation
document issuer, and submit an HTTP request:

```python
from atls import ATLSContext, HTTPAConnection
from atls.validators.azure.aas import AciValidator

validator = AciValidator()
ctx = ATLSContext([validator])
conn = HTTPAConnection("my.confidential.service.net", ctx)

conn.request("GET", "/index")

response = conn.getresponse()

print(f"Status: {response.status}")
print(f"Response: {response.data.decode()}")

conn.close()
```

Alternatively, this package integrates into the
[`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) library by using the `httpa://`
scheme in lieu of `https://`, like so:

```python
import requests

from atls.utils.requests import HTTPAAdapter
from atls.validators.azure.aas import AciValidator

validator = AciValidator()
session = requests.Session()
session.mount("httpa://", HTTPAAdapter([validator]))

response = session.request("GET", "httpa://my.confidential.service.net/index")

print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

**Note**: The `requests` library is not marked as a dependency of this package
because it is not required for its operation. As such, if you wish to use
`requests`, install it via `pip install requests` prior to importing
`HTTPAAdapter`.
