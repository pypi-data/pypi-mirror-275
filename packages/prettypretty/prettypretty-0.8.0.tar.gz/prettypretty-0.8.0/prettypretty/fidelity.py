    A terminal's color fidelity.

    When it comes to terminal color support, there are four levels, starting
    with no-color, then the 16 extended ANSI colors, then 8-bit colors, which
    directly incorporate ANSI colors, and finally "truecolor," i.e., RGB256.
    Since no-color still allows for styling text with ANSI escape codes,
    fidelity also includes the plain level, which prohibits the use of escapes.

    Even though there is no established mapping between ANSI and RGB256 colors,
    the latter nonetheless subsumes ANSI, most certainly when it comes to
    display hardware. Historically, no-color was the norm for terminals. In
    fact, even though DEC's VT100 series of terminals popularized ANSI escape
    codes, none of the models in that series had color monitors. Nowadays,
    no-color is important for modelling restricted runtime environments, e.g.,
    as found on continuous integration services. Meanwhile plain is important
    when producing machine-readable output. Furthermore, both no-color and plain
    can capture user preferences.

    The original use case for fidelity levels is serving as bounds that restrict
    renderable colorsâ€”and renderable styles in case of the plain level. Unless
    the bound is plain or no-color, color formats and spaces outside the bound
    need to be converted to *one of the formats* within the bound. In almost all
    cases, that means converting a color to the bound's format (denoted by the
    bound's name in lower case).

    However, there are three complications.

     1. When the fidelity level is RGB256, the original color may very well be
        outside of RGB256's gamut as well. Since gamut mapping is more accurate
        with floating point coordinates, preparing colors for RGB256 requires
        first conversion to sRGB, then gamut mapping, and finally conversion to
        RGB256.
     2. Since RGB6 is a three-component version of (part of) 8-bit color,
        converting to 8-bit color suffices for fidelity levels of 8-bit and
        RGB256. In the latter case, 8-bit color may not be the bound's format
        but it certainly is within the bound. Converting RGB6 to 8-bit is a
        reasonable first step for ANSI fidelity, too.
     3. When the fidelity level is ANSI and the original color is 8-bit with a
        component value between -1 and 15 inclusive, a trivial re-tagging of the
        color suffices. Technically, -1 stands for the default color. But that
        color is part of the core ANSI colors, too.

    A second use case helps avoid repeated inspections and attempted conversions
    when colors may be shared and reused through style objects. It is based on
    the observation that a fidelity level can also serve as a concise summary of
    past color conversions. Here, :attr:`NOCOLOR` implies a lack of colors and
    no fidelity implies a lack of inspection.

    Fidelity levels form a total order and support Python's comparison
    operators.
