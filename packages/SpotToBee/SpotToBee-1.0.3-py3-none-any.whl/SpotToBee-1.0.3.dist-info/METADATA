# SpotToBee
SpotToBee is a command-line tool for converting Spotify and other CSV playlists to an .xautopf format compatible with MusicBee. Fetching data from Spotify requires SpotifyClient Credentials from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard. The tool can be used without credentials alongside https://exportify.net/. The tool can also be used to export a basic .csv of a Spotify playlist.

## Installation

    pip install SpotToBee

Running SpotToBee will automatically create a config file in its run directory. This can be manually reset by passing the --reconfigure argument.
## Usage/Examples

    SpotToBee path/to/playlist.csv
