This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install p99Bluesky`
Documentation   | <https://relm-arrowny.github.io/p99Bluesky>
Releases        | <https://github.com/Relm-Arrowny/p99Bluesky/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from p99Bluesky import __version__

print(f"Hello p99Bluesky {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m p99Bluesky --version
```
