## Background

The initiation of this project had the goal of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind Python packages, their distribution, and the process of releasing them. Poetry, a project and dependency management tool, was employed to achieve this objective. The resulting package was designed for internal use across different Python projects, including [advertisements-test](https://github.com/hubzaj/advertisements-test). Its main purpose is to provide insight into package management intricacies while serving as a valuable resource for a variety of Python projects.
