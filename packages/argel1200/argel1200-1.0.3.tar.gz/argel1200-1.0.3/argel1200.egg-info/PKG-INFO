## argel1200.utilities
A small collection of utility functions that help reduce boilerplate code.

### dumps
Wrapper for dumper, to make it eaier to get Perl style Data Dumper output. Assumes you want strings back, and leverages get_variable_name to pull the calling function.

####
get_variable_name

Helper function used by dumps. Perl's Data::Dumper gives variable_name=value output. This seeks to mimic that.

### import_class_from_string
Useful when you need to (or it's just more elegant to) dynamically determine the class based on a string that you are obtaining dynamically at runtime. Useful if you have a base class and multiple subclasses. Very useful if you want to build out your classes as needed (something can just be a base class now, then later on you could create a sub class for it and your script will start loading it as the new sub class automatically)

### logging_init
Uses haggis.logs to add two additional "debug" logging levels: 'TRACE' and 'MEMDUMP' and initializes a logging instance if return_logger is True.

### open_file
Wrapper for opening a file that provides basic error handling. Get those try blocks out of _your_ script!

### process_cli_using_click
Useful if you want to use click in standalone=False mode. 
Provides basic error handling (required for standalone=False)
