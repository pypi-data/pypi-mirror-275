    <text> The Prologue . As the philosopher , in the fyrst booke of hys metaphysyque , sayth , *that* every man / naturally desireth to know / and to con newe thynges : And therfore have the Clerkes / ＆ people / of great vnderstandynge desyred and concite to lerned sciences , and to know vertues of thinges . Some by Phylosophy , other by Poetrye , and other by Historyes / and cronyikes / of thynges passed . And vpo*n* these three they have greatly laboured / in suche *that* thanked be God , by theyr good dylygence / and laboures , they have had greate knowledge by innumerable volumes of bookes , whiche have be made / and compyled by great studye and payne / vnto thys day . And bycause that above all thinges , the princes ＆ lordes of hie estate and entendement / desyre to see thystoryes / of the ryght noble and hye vertues of the prodecessours / whiche ben digne , and worthy of remembraunce of perpetuall recommendation . Therfore , late at y^e^ request and commaundement of the ryght noble and vertus Erle Iohn , Erle of Oxeforde , my good synguler / and especial lorde , I reduced and translated out of Frenche , into our maternall and Englyshe tongue , the lyfe of one of his predecessoures , named Robert , Erle of Oxeforde , tofore sayd , w*ith*</text>

And also that my sayd Lorde / desyreth to have other Hystories of olde tyme / pa*sse*d of vertues chyvalry , reduced in lykewyse into our Englishe to*n*gue : he late sent to me a booke in Frenche , conteynyng thactes / and faytes of warre / doone and made agaynst y^e^ great Emperour and king of Fraunce , Charlemagne , by y^e^ .iiii. sonnes of Aymon , otherwyse named in Frenche , ' Les quatre fylz Aymon . ' Whyche booke , accordynge to hys request , I have endevorde me to accomplyshe / and to reduce it into our englyshe , to my great coste / and charges , as in the translatinge / as in enprynting of the same , hopying ＆ not doubtyng / but that hys good grace / shall rewarde me in suche wise that I shall have cause to pray for his good and prosperus welfare . And besechynge his said noble good grace / to pardon me of y^e^ rude , and this simple worke . For , accordyng to the coppy / whyche he se*n*t to me , I have folowed as nigh as I can , and where as , as any defaute shall be founde , I submyt me to the correction of them / that vnderstande the cronycle ＆ history , besethyng the*m* to correcte it ＆ amende there / as they shall fynde faute . And I shall praye almighty God for them that so doo , to rewarde them in suche wyse , that after this shorte / and transytory lyfe , we all may come to everlastyng lyfe in heven . Amen . ¶ Thus endeth the prologue : Heere foloweth the Table of this presente booke .

    <text> Item howe Reynawde slew the nevew of king Charlemagne with a chesse boorde , as they plaied togyther at the chesse , wherof the warre began , the whiche was so mortall / and lasted so longe , that it bare a great dommage to the realme of Fraunce . The thirde chapitre speaketh , how after that kynge Charlemagne hadde made all his barons to forsake the foure sonnes of aymon / He went and besyeged them at mou*n*tenforde , where he was dyscomfyted two tymes ; but the castelle of Mou*n*tenforde was taken , after that , by tr*e*ason . And after , howe Reynawde and his bretherne avenged theim of the traytoures that betrayed theym , And after saved theym selfe wythin the forest of Ardeyne , Where theyr father found the*m* / as he went from the syege / to warde his londe of Dordon .

And howe the kynge of Gascoygn , wha*n* they were come there / dyd receive them in his servise ryghte sweetly , in bourdeux vpon Gyrond , by cause / that than this king of Gascoigne , that was called Yon , had warre agenst a kyng sarasin / that was entred into Gascoyne , that had to name Portus , that helde Tholouse and all the londe aboute . The VI chapter speaketh how Reinawde / and his bretherne / dystressed bourgous , a sarasyn that had distroyed the realme of Gascoign , and had chased the kinge yon / to bordeux vpon Gyronde , that durste not departe from thence , for feare of the sarasyns .
