# Discrete Event Simulation

Discrete event simulation is a type of computer-based modeling technique used to simulate complex systems characterized by discrete, sequential events. These events occur at distinct points in time and have specific attributes or characteristics. In discrete event simulation, the system under study is represented as a series of events that influence the state of the system over time.

## Event-Based Discrete Event Simulation

Event-based discrete event simulation (also known as event-driven discrete event simulation) is a specific approach within discrete event simulation where the simulation engine is primarily driven by the occurrence of events. In event-based simulation, the simulation clock only advances when there are pending events to be processed, rather than advancing continuously at fixed time intervals.
