        file_format="csv",
    )
parent_path = Path(__file__).parent
sample_file_path = parent_path.resolve() / "data" / "sample_prices.csv"

with open(sample_file_path, "rb") as sample_file:
    file_contents = sample_file.read()
    sample_file_bytesio = BytesIO(file_contents)
    yaml_content = validator.get_yaml_content(validator.url)
    validated_df = validator.load_and_validate_file(my_upload=sample_file_bytesio, yaml_content=yaml_content)
