# ensurepath

Does exactly one thing:

- ensure that python, pip and with pip installed binarys are in your path.



## USAGE

If `python` command is available:
```bash
$ python -m pip install ensurepath
...
$ python -m ensurepath
...
```
Otherwise:
```bash
$ [path to python] -m pip install ensurepath
...
$ [path to python] -m ensurepath
...
```

## Why

The need occured for me when we started using pipx in a python class just to use `pipx ensurepath`.
That is because the micrsoft store (msstore) install of python does add `python` and `pip` to the path, but not the `scripts` folder where with pip installed shell commands are located.
I tried to also make this script add pip and python to the path if they are not in yet, but have not tested this further.

## msstore

If you're installing python from the msstore and also want that the commands that are installed with the installed packages to just work on the comandline, you're exactly right here!

# Issues

If you encouter any error feel free to create an issue and I will try to help, when I have the time. But this is not a python install support service ;-)

This how not been tested thoroughly use at your own risk!

# Thanks
This script only uses the [`userpath`](https://pypi.org/project/userpath/) module from [ofek](https://github.com/ofek), without you this wouldn't be possible! Thanks for your great work on `userpath`!
