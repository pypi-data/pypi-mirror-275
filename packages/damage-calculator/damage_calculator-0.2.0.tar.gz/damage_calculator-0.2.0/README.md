# Pokemon Damage Calculator

This is a simple Python package for calculating damage in Pokemon battles based on user input.

## for example
move_power = 100  # Power of the move
attacker_attack = 150  # Attack stat of the attacking Pokémon
defender_defense = 100  # Defense stat of the defending Pokémon
stab = 1.5  # Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB)
type_effectiveness = 2.0  # Type effectiveness (e.g., super effective)

result=x
