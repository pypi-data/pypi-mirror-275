tf_idf
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This file will become your README and also the index of your
documentation.

## Install

``` sh
pip install tf_idf
```

## How to use

Fill me in please! Donâ€™t forget code examples:

``` python
import tf_idf.core as tf_idf
import pandas as pd
```

``` python
AI = 'For instance, in the design phase of a structural engineering project, Monte Carlo simulations can help evaluate the performance of a proposed design under different loading conditions and material properties, providing valuable insights into its reliability and safety'
ME = 'For instance, Monte Carlo simulations can simulate hundreds or thousands of different combinations of loading conditions and material properties to create statistical predictions of structure stiffness'
# word_tokenize(AI.lower().split())
# preprocess_text(AI)
```

``` python
compare = tf_idf.preprocess_text(AI)
```

``` python
compare = pd.concat([compare, preprocess_text(ME)], ignore_index=True)
compare
```
