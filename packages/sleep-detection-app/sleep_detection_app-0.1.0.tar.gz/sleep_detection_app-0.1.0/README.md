# Sleep Detection App

This Python application detects if the user is sleeping using the computer's webcam. It uses face detection and eye closure detection to determine if the user is asleep. If the user is away from the computer, they can press a button to temporarily pause the alarm and detection. They can resume detection by pressing another button when they return.

## Installation

You can install the Sleep Detection App via pip:

```bash
pip install sleep-detection-app
