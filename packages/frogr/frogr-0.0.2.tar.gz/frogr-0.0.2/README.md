## Features

- Use the ATMO equilibrium chemistry plugin in your TauREx 3.1 forward models and retrievals.

## Requirements

- Ensure that you have a working installation of ATMO on your machine (https://www.gitlab.erc-atmo.eu/1-2d_tools/atmo). If you need access to ATMO, please contact Pascal Tremblin: pascal.tremblin@cea.fr
- You will need a working installation of TauREx 3.1 on your machine, with associated required Python packages: https://taurex3-public.readthedocs.io/

## Installation

You can install _frogr_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install frogr
```

Alternatively, clone this Github and install via terminal with. This is done by:

Cloning the directory using:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/michellebieger/frogr.git
```

Move into _frogr_'s folder:

```console
$ cd frogr
```

Install by then typing in:

```console
$ pip install .
```

If you are unable to install, a common error for HPC systems can be the Poetry log install requirements, which dictate a high-level version of Python. Try creating a new `conda` environment and then try `pip install`'ing once more:

```console
$ conda create -n [insertpreferredenvname] python=3.8
```

You can check the installation by importing _frogr_ into Python:

```console
$ python -c "import frogr"
```

To check that TauREx 3.1 has correctly registered your plugin:

```console
$ taurex --plugins
```

If there are no errors, you have been successful!
