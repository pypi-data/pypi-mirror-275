## DCSpy
DCSpy is able to pull information from DCS aircraft and display on Logitech G-series keyboards LCD.

Features:
* Logitech device with 160x43 px (4 lines) monochrome LCD - **G13**, **G15 (v1 and v2)** and **G510**
* Logitech device with 320x240 px (8 lines) full RGBA LCD - **G19**
* Support for other [Logitech devices](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki/Supported-devices):
  * Keyboards: **G910**, **G710**, **G110**, **G105**, **G103**, **G11**
  * Headphones: **G35**, **G633**, **G930**, **G933**
  * Mouses: **G600**, **G300**, **G400**, **G700**, **G9**, **MX518**, **G402**, **G502**, **G602**
* Setup G-Keys to any toggle, switch or knob in cockpit - [Setup of G-Keys](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki/Usage#how-to-setup)
* Support for all aircraft (official and mods) with clickable cockpits - [DCS-BIOS aircraft](https://github.com/DCS-Skunkworks/dcs-bios#is-my-aircraft-supported)
* Modern looking GUI using Qt6/PySide6

See more information on [Wiki](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki) page.

## Aircraft and instruments
There are to kinds of supported aircraft:
* **Basic** - allow assigning all G-Keys of Logitech keyboard to aircraft's instruments in the cockpit (all clickable cockpits supported by DCS-BIOS)
* **Advanced** - additionally can display some information on LCD (listed below)

Why such way? Basically advanced support is for aircraft that I own and therefore can test it.

# Advanced
* F/A-18C Hornet UFC - Up Front Controller
* F-16C Viper DED - Data Entry Display
* Ka-50 Black Shark II and III - PVI-800 and autopilot channels
* Mi-8MTV2 Hip - autopilot channels and Radios information
* Mi-24P Hind - Autopilot channels and modes and Radios information
* A-10C Warthog and A-10C II Tank Killer - Radio frequency information
* F-14A and F-14B Tomcat - basic support for RIO CAP
* AV-8B Night Attack Harrier - Up Front Controller and Option Display Unit
* AH-64D Apache - Enhanced Up Front Display
* F-15E Eagle - Upfront Control Panel
* F-4 Phantom II - UHF (ARC 164) Radio
* more to come...

## Requirements
* [Logitech Gaming Software 9.04.49](https://support.logitech.com/software/lgs)
* DCS-Skunkworks DCS-BIOS:
  * [DCS-BIOS 0.8.0](https://github.com/DCS-Skunkworks/dcs-bios/releases/tag/v0.8.0) or newer (can be [installed](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki/Upgrade#manual-procedure) directly from DCSpy)
  * However, it is recommended use [Live DCS-BIOS](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki/Information#live-dcs-bios) as latest git version
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) it is necessary for using live version of DCS-BIOS
* DCS World: [2.9.5.55300](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/news/changelog/stable/2.9.5.55300/), but any version from 2.9.* branch should be fine.
* optional:
  * [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) but 3.9+ should be fine (see [installation](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki/installation))
  * However, DCSpy 2.3.3 and earlier do not support Python 3.12

**Notes:**
* If you upgrade DCSpy from 1.5.1 or older, you can safely remove Logitech LCD SDK from `C:\Program Files\Logitech Gaming Software\LCDSDK_8.57.148`. Since DCSpy version 1.6.0 uses built-in SDK in LGS (Logitech Gaming Software).

## New ideas
I have lots of plans and new ideas how to improve it internally and form a user's perspective, but don't hesitate to contact me. Maybe it will motivate me to implement some new stuff. Please open issue if you find a bug or have any crazy idea.
