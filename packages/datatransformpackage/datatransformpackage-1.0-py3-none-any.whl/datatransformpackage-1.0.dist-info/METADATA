# DataTransformLib

DataTransformLib is a Python library designed to assist data scientists with common data transformation tasks. This library provides functions to transpose matrices, generate time series windows, and perform 2D convolutions, making it easier to handle and manipulate data efficiently.

## Features

- **Transpose Matrices**: Transpose 2D matrices provided as lists or file paths.
- **Time Series Windowing**: Generate overlapping windows from a 1D input array.
- **2D Convolution**: Perform 2D convolution on matrices with a specified kernel and stride.

## Installation

You can install DataTransformLib from PyPI using `pip`:

```sh
pip install DataTransformLib
