# Cosmix

A dead simple CLI-based launcher for Cosmic Reach and Cosmic Quilt.

## Installation

```sh
# From PyPI (recommended)
python3 -m pip install cosmix-launcher

# From source
git clone https://codeberg.org/emmathemartian/cosmix && cd cosmix
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m build
python3 -m pip install ./dist/*.whl
```

To makes sure it's installed, run `cosmix version`. You should see `[info]: Cosmix <some version>` in the console.

> If the command is not found, make sure your `~/.local/bin/` is on your `$PATH`.

If you have any issues, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

<!--TODO: List the Windows script $PATH here as well.-->

### Updating

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade cosmix-launcher
```

### Uninstallation

```sh
python3 -m pip uninstall cosmix-launcher
# If you also want to delete your instances, delete ~/.local/share/cosmix (or %APPDATA%\cosmix on Windows)
```

### Troubleshooting

**Arch Linux:**

Arch Linux and its derivatives may complain with `error: externally-managed-environment`. To get around this, use the `--user --break-system-packages` options with `pip install`.

> Obviously this has a chance of breaking something, but in my testing I have yet to have that happen. Though be aware and know that I am not responsible if you break your system.

**Maven:**

You may also need to install Maven. On Arch Linux this is just `pacman -S maven`.

> Maven is used to download and resolve all of Cosmic Quilt's dependencies automatically. If you are a developer, you will probably have this downloaded already. You can check by running `mvn -v` in your terminal.

### Dependencies

> `hjson tqdm requests crm1 Send2Trash click click-aliases java-manifest`

To install and/or upgrade all of them at once, just run:

`python3 -m pip install --upgrade hjson tqdm requests crm1 Send2Trash click click-aliases java-manifest`

```

## File Structure

Cosmix stores all of its data in your `$XDG_DATA_HOME` (typically `~/.local/share/`) on Linux and `%APPDATA%` on Windows and in the `cosmix` folder.

This folder will contain the following extra folders:
```
cosmix/
    config.hjson - Configs for Cosmix

    deps/
        cosmic-reach/
            Contains JARs for each downloaded Cosmic Reach version.
        cosmic-quilt/
            Contains the JAR dependencies for each downloaded Cosmic Quilt version.

    instances/
        example-instance/
            config.hjson - Configs for the instance.
            deps/
                If the instance is modded, this folder is used to store extra dependencies for the classpath. Typically this will be unused.
```
